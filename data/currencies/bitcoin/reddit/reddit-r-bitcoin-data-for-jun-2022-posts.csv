According to information from The Elec, which is a specialized media of the South Korean technology industry, Samsung will sell the nanochips or semiconductors to PanSemi, which is a subsidiary of the company that gives life to Whatsminer ASICs. A semiconductor is a circuit that is responsible for processing energy to make an electronic device work.

Another boost to technological development related to the blockchain world, which is getting closer and closer to everyone, if Samsung approaches bitcoin, this will accelerate the approach of bitcoin to the world more and more as a means of payment, as it is already done in several online stores, such as Exeno.

Although mentioned earlier, The Elec removed the mining firm's name from its original post. However, on Twitter, the Hashrate Index account echoed the announcement.
If the chips have fewer nanometers, there is likely to be more power efficiency and better performance when operating, as the distance between electrical transistors would decrease. 

This, as far as ASICs are concerned, means gain and advantage, knowing that most hardware on the market operates with 5nm semiconductors.",Samsung's new 3nm chips to hit Bitcoin miners first,65

post,voatel,2s3qj,bitcoin,false,1656602158,https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/voatel/announcing_my_new_lightning_network_based_service/,self.bitcoin,,"Hey everyone, I am here to selfishly shill a project I've been working on for about 3 months in the hopes of profiting monetarily!  (Kidding, but of course, also not)

TL;DR:  Go to https://sattr.io , sign up, and subscribe to any tags you may be able to help (and earn sats) with.  (Also, read to the end to see 2 ways you can earn some bonus sats)

I wanted to apply the Lightning Network to the world of consultation and tech support, and in doing so, I have created Sattr.io.  Sattr is designed to incentivize skilled and knowledgeable users to provide fast help to other users.

I believe the Lightning Network opens up so many possibilities for online services.  Sometimes, the limitations and costs of the current payment systems make certain ideas unproductive.  With the Lightning Network and it's instant almost-free transactions, though, these things become possible.

A user can deposit some sats, open a ""huddle"" dedicated to a question, and choose some amount of sats to solving their problem.  The user simply selects up to 3 tags, and anyone that is subscribed to those tags will be notified via email and in their browser.  When someone responds and answers the question, the huddle owner can close the huddle and pay the person who answered.

With traditional means, it wouldn't be worth the effort to make an entire transaction to pay someone $2 so you can get a quick answer on a question about C++ that's holding you up.  The alternative is joining a Discord, which I love, but so often I post a question on a Discord server and it takes hours for someone to see the question in the sea of other questions.  With Sattr, we can give just a few (or a lot of) sats to incentivize someone to help us quickly.

It's far from perfect, and most certainly in beta.  I have limited the amount of sats you can use to open a huddle to make sure some error doesn't go costing someone too many sats, but this limit will be increased as testing continues.

CHANCE TO EARN EXTRA SATS:  Join my [huddle](https://sattr.io/h/huddle?hid=62bdbb9c55b1ac385f3e62e9) and chat to me.  I'll close the huddle in a few days and split the sats between everyone who gave constructive feedback.

CHANCE TO WIN SATS:  500,000 sats are up for grabs!  After 100 huddles have been opened and answered, one huddle will be selected at random.  The owner *and* the answerer will both be given 500,000 sats.  There are no conditions, except that I will be checking the huddle to make sure it is legitimate, and if it is not, a new huddle will be randomly selected.","Announcing my new Lightning Network based service, where you can earn sats by answering other users' questions: Sattr.io",12

Personally, I think this is it.

And after the next halving, it will be an explosion towards widespread adoption as conservatives globally start racing each other to accumulate as much as possible.

But truthfully, who knows! I could be very wrong.

I'll leave you with these thoughts:With FIAT, you have people who suck up all the cash and spend little of it, rather keeping it within friend circles in power. They lend it out to people who are vulnerable and gain interest whilst also having the option to print more FIAT so that your savings is worth less whilst they can lend you more money at interest rates that keep them filthy rich.But worst of all, you can lose your savings when your banks make malinvestments and then still get bailed out by more money prints.With Bitcoin you have people who suck it up, making them incredibly rich.You can be a poor person saving it very slowly; maybe you won't ever be able to buy a house.You can be a rich person, that moves to bitcoin and become even more rich.But you can't print more.

That simple fact means that if 1 billion people want to use bitcoin equally, they would only be able to have 0.021 BTC each, and it would never change.

Hypothetically, if just 1 billion people start getting paid salaries in BTC, that would mean that it would need to be much less than 0.021 BTC (and that's ignoring all the things such as completely lost BTC or the fact that some people will still not be selling their large amounts). Of course I don't think BTC will be used for salaries, but it's just to give you an idea of the scale needed for BTC to go cosmic.

And finally people always say ""BTC can't go above $1million because that would mean the MCAP would be $21 trillion."" but is it really a market? I would argue that due to its decentralisation, it's not. No single entity or country owns the network or controls it. And of course 1 btc = 1 btc. 

To me, it's transactional power globally. It's the general potential transactional purchasing power of the network. Over $5 trillion worth of currency is traded every day and maybe we should stop looking at MCAP and start looking at the daily total value of transactions, because why does MCAP even matter when we are dealing with a truly decentralized method of transaction?",Last chance to be considered an early adopter?,5

But that has nothing to do with the ""*bitcoins*"" scarcity. The block reward can be changed to give out 500 bitcoins per block, or 1000, or 1000000, you get the point. The scarcity is just from social consensus (a convention) that we keep it at 21M as a rule.

So if bitcoins are scarce as a result of agreed-upon rules. What makes it so special then? I mean, theoretically, we could do the same with fiat money. We can agree on a certain supply and not change it. The only reason this has never happened is because a commitment to a fixed supply will attract foreign speculation on a nation's currency leading its value to jump around; destroying its stability and value as a medium of exchange. 

I agree that maybe because of its transparency it is easier to enforce a wide agreement on supply, but it shouldn't be compared to gold which is actually scarce due to physics.","I'm honestly confused why people believe bitcoins are ""scarce"".",0

Upon this basis of ignorance a lot of questionable strategies are built.

So how does the fiat monetary system operate?

Fiat money is a state imposed monopoly, but in practice the vast bulk of fiat money is issued as debt. When a private bank issues a new loan or mortgage it creates new fiat money as a balance in the recipients bank account. This money is created out of thin air and yet the bank charges interest upon it until the debt is paid off. Nice business for the bankers.

The effect of this constant issuance of debt increasing the monetary supply is the value of all existing money constantly declining driving people to consume more and incentivising people to take on debt to buy hard assets which will appreciate. This has been the self reinforcing paradigm of the fiat monetary system for several decades but which is now reaching a crisis point.

The cost of debt is now being increased upon a huge recent increase in debt extended during the recent very very low interest rates. Central banks will raise the price of debt to try to control inflation but raising it too much risks leading to default on debts and the entire edifice of fiat money collapsing.

The fiat debt based monetary system has rewarded debt leveraged speculation but has undermined the economy by undermining the very fundamental principles of capitalism. Capitalism assumes the accumulation of capital (in the form of cash savings) via deferred gratification- those who save money are then empowered to invest that money as they choose. However the fiat debt system of monetary issuance grants a much easier method of capital issuance to the private banks who are licensed to create new fiat money out of thin air. This is how fiat money has undermined your property rights and capitalism itself for many decades.

Is there an alternative? Yes, now there is!

Bitcoin is a working model alternative to the fiat debt monetary system.

Bitcoin restores the inherent ability to save capital without it being constantly and relentlessly debased by rentseeking bankers.

Note- a higher ratio of NZs GDP is extracted by foreign bankers than any other OECD nation.

The big 4 'Aussie' banks in New Zealand are in fact all majority owned by US domiciled shareholders. In addition to this a large proportion of their profits are extracted tax free via the intermediary funders who provide the USD capital backing which is charged as a tax deductible expense and remitted to the funding intermediaries free of tax. Shareholders in these banks do not see any of the millions remitted to the intermediary capital funders. Both tax and shareholders are bypassed...

The structure of the fiat debt slavery banking cartel matches almost precisely the military structures and hierarchy that support its global imposition.

NZs annual tribute of several billion dollars to the US via Australian proxy banks is paralleled by the subservience of the EU, Japan and Britain to US monetary and military hegemony.",The nature of the fiat debt slavery cartel is little understood by the general public because secrecy and opaqueness and control of the narrative are key features in its operational model.

   I  thought Bitcoin was a huge scam. But as I did my research, it just somehow clicked.  I thought to myself ‚ÄúWOW, this is it. This is the fucking future..‚Äù At that point, I was all in, and there was no turning back. Let me explain the future I saw at that moment.

   Bitcoin unlocks the velocity of money just like the internet has done with the velocity of data. It is sound money and unlike the dollar, there is clear and finite supply, it‚Äôs decentralized and everyone can participate in it.

   For example, why do we need to wait 2 weeks for a paycheck? Why not get paid every minute or every second? If you receive at the speed of light, you can also re-invest at the speed of light and automate payments, savings, investments, decentralized finance, just about everything related to money and much more.

   For example, if you rent out properties, why not collect rent every minute? Any income you make you can immediately re-invest via smart-contracts and generate returns without delay. You can purchase fractional shares of property, or even lend out money and collect interest at a great velocity.

   With 5G coming online,it will open up the bandwidth for applications in the future that we haven‚Äôt even thought of. For example, we can eliminate stop signs and traffic lights with self-driving cars negotiating the right of way for fractions of a penny based on bids and who is in a hurry. Securities trading on wall street can be done on the block-chain with high transparency. It will open global commerce on a larger scale - How about a small business owner in Japan wanting to sell something online to someone overseas? There doesn‚Äôt need to be any middlemen brokering or slowing down transfers or currency conversion. In my small business, it can speed up collecting my accounts receivables by lightyears and smart contracts that collect interest if my customers are paying late. 

   We are early. While everyone is fixated on the price, I‚Äôm seeing the future and such a huge potential for this technology. This is the native currency of the internet. I‚Äôm all in on the idea of bitcoin and if it does survive, It just might pay off.

So besides price.. What do YOU see in Bitcoin?","While everyone was looking at the price, I saw the future.",152

We would love your input and feedback on our latest project. We have a landing page for the project at [https://www.airpasswallet.com](https://www.airpasswallet.com/).

We believe that there will eventually be a hybrid approach to ""wallets"" depending on the purpose; convenient hot wallets and secure cold/hardware wallets. Considering the current state of cold/hardware wallets, they are ok for us current Bitcoin enthusiasts and early adopters, but they are too complicated for mass adoption. We want to bridge that gap.

We have created a cold/hardware wallet for your passwords with our Stash Password Manager product ([https://stashpasswordmanager.com](https://stashpasswordmanager.com/)) using our patented Island Technology. Here is a YouTube link to an explainer video on how it works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ON9EbPan28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ON9EbPan28). We created an air-gapped computer that interacts like a tap card with your phone that requires the user to physically engage with the device for it to work, with no battery or cables. This gives the user ultimate control over their data. This is not an NFC tag but we do use NFC communication.

We hope to use this technology to help Bitcoin adoption by making using Bitcoin as simple to use as something people are already used to using, like a tap credit card.

Some topics we hope to discuss here are:  
\- What pain points you are facing with existing products on the market?  
\- What do you wish existing products let you do or didn't force you to do?  
\- What features are must-haves in a hardware wallet, and what are extras?  
\- We can add almost anything to our cards, such as a display, fingerprint reader, light indicators, and input keypad, but what is that simple combination of features that is necessary for functionality but provides a streamlined user experience? Remember, the device engages with a phone, so some features may be better suited to be directly on the phone.

The problem I see is that unfortunately there is a big quantity of scammers using bitcoin to ask for fake donations.

Of course users should donate through the official channels and such but I'm thinking more about the stigma to the whole bitcoin donation thing.

As far as I know there are a couple of ways to receive donations:

- Just share the bitcoin address. Downside is everybody knows how much you received and the addresses donating. Higher fees.
- Lightning network and a service supporting LNurl for recurring donations. More secure, lower fees and better all around if not for the ""hassle"" of someone having to setup a channel and having an active lighting network.

So in your case, would you be more inclined to donate one way or another? Keep both? Or rather, a third option?

Four possibilities come to mind:

1. Missing data - Perhaps the files I'm grep'ing are incomplete, but I did some checks and it looks good to me. I suspect the data is good.
2. Recorded a long time ago - Perhaps this was recorded before September 2021, which I think is unlikely, but possible.
3. Hacker doing hacky things - Again, I think this is unlikely, the guy appears to be reputable, but it could be possible that this technical expert transferred funds out of the wallet and made the wallet app throw bogus data?
4. Something else?

Therefore I want to share this list of [590+ demonetized currencies](https://www.bitrawr.com/demonetized-currencies) &amp; an explanation as to why I believe that all fiat will suffer the same faith. Commodities like bitcoin or gold will always win out over fiat because they need energy to be created. Something that can be produced without energy input will always be abundant and therefore cannot store value. Fiat dies through hyperinflation, war, independence &amp; monetary reform. None will last as long as gold has already. Hard money (inelastic supply) will win. BTC could be such a hard money.",All Fiat will fail! Latest victim: Zimbabwe Dollar (ZWL),0

Shouldn‚Äôt there be some wallets that allow you to beam a signed transaction over to the merchant via nfc, bt or qr? Where the merchant might have either a more reliable internet connection or a cached blockchain synced recently while they had a connection. The wallet could keep track of its spent utxo locally and assume no other wallet spent it until its connected again to re-sync with the chain.

Maybe lightning can fit better into this in some way rather than 1st layer utxo management.

It could even be something like a physical card or low power device with nfc to be charged up with its own utxo which it manages signing for similar to debit cards, in case battery power is also an issue.

Use cases I can think about would be on markets, airplanes, boats and maybe even in war times where connectivity would be more sporadic.

   3. Harden it - encode it in a Kryo dot or a ColdTI 
   4. Memorize it - ""Silently"" repeat it until you will never forget it
   5. Hide it - Find a hidden location to make sure that a random person cannot find it
3. Learn about how bitcoin works",Reminder: Please review your security practices while stacking sats,16

Russia knew very well the way out of the USD was blockchain. BRICS nations want to get out of the USD. BTC has been lauded as the only independent and truly decentralized currency. But what if it really was just genius misdirection?? 

The US wants to maintain it's perception as the most benign world power and a bastion of ""freedom""...it cannot outright ban BTC or privately issued crypto...it would make them tyrannical. 

So why not just let the BRICS backbone DLT develop until the majority of the world has to trade by BRICS terms...using their network and let THEM ban BTC??

I never mentioned Bitcoin or suggested it and the amount of downvotes and backlash was very interesting. One guy checked my account and said ""ah the average wisdom of a r/Bitcoin member"" or something like that.

It was just very interesting to see people's defense toward FIAT and the amount of hatred towards Bitcoin. I guess they just have so much trust in the system  that when someone says otherwise they get defensive.

Michael Sailor discusses his view that Bitcoin will lead to a more peaceful future because the only way to extract Bitcoin from someone is to ""sweat it out of them"".  I believe this is a true observation.   Bitcoin keys can only be extracted under severe duress.  

In a bankruptcy filling for example.  The creditors will have no way to get at the assets directly if they are stored in Bitcoin.  The only option for the judge is to lock the person away until they disclose their keys.

His 4 reasons:

1. Bitcoin becomes de facto proof-of-stake. Proof-of-stake wouldn't be added to the code, however, large exchanges would end up running their own mining operations to keep minting new blocks because the 'security budget' (block rewards) would become too little to sustain a large ASIC industry. Meaning: not enough reward fees per block (and the newly generated coins would be too few because of many halvings).
2. Some huge bug. Would be recoverable, but need to restart the ledger to a prior point in time.
3. Quantum threat. Nic believes we might be underestimating the pace at which quantum computing is moving. Elliptic curve signatures as well as Schnorr signatures would be imperiled. Coins with revealed public key addresses are quantum vulnerable (e.g. Satoshi's coins). If quantum supremacy suddenly happened, the blockchain would need to be halted, updates implemented etc. Messy.
4. A good algorithmic stablecoin. With an algorithmic monetary policy that's more reactive to the economy, would allow for something more price stable.

He estimates the percentage chance of every threat in the 5-10% range, so about 25% in total that one of these end up happening.

Let's say you lived in Argentina and you wanted to store your value. The obvious move is to sell all your weak currency for, say, the USD. I would say this is not ""investing"" in USD, it is ""saving"" in USD.

So the same is true for Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, we are exiting a weaker currency for a stronger one. It's not really an investment, we are *saving* in Bitcoin.

At least for me, when I discuss Bitcoin now I am going to start making a conscious effort to stop saying ""investing"" and start using ""saving"" instead. 

I guess some people do ""invest"" in Bitcoin, perhaps people who buy and sell a year later. But if like me you are holding this for life, it's not an investment, it's literally my savings.

I also think this term will go help it be better understood by value investors who don't see the appeal of Bitcoin and dismiss it off the bat.",Terminology discussion: investing vs saving,4

In Lebanon, millions of people have lost access to their life savings, people who once had tens of thousands of dollars in the bank, have all but lost it. When people go to the bank to access their money, they are hassled and denied access. 

If you for example want to withdraw $100, they will ask you why you need this much? What will you do with this money? No matter what answer you give, they will always give you less, $20 is all you will get today. If you want to check your balance, they will look at it, but will not allow you access to that information, and sometimes they even use fake data.

Access to retirements and savings is all but gone, and what you can access is at the discretion of the bank. This is mainly because the money has all but been stolen, and not there, so to cover up, they have created this almost impossible barrier.

This centralized system has exploited and continues to exploit the people, and with no control over their own money, people have been robbed of everything they have worked so hard to obtain.

So what happened?

Nearly 22 days ago, Huobi froze $USDP (Pax Dollar) entirely. If you have $USDP in Huobi, you can't do ANYTHING with it at all.

This was the [announcement](https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/84908475721081):

&gt;As the Paxos Standard project will be updating its (Paxos Standard)PAX Ticker to USDP,¬† Huobi Global will be suspending the trading, withdrawals and deposits of PAX from 02:00 (UTC) on June 6, 2022 until the update is completed.

Here is what's wrong:

1. Paxos has already rebranded and renamed the ticker (in the smart contract) [nearly a year ago.](https://www.theblock.co/linked/115461/paxos-is-rebranding-its-stablecoin-from-pax-to-usdp)
2. Huobi gave users a small window to act (less than a day) and didn't notify them by email.
3. What's the rush for renaming a ticker now during the most volatile time of the cycle when traders need their funds the most, especially that rebranding happened a year ago!

I asked Huobi for a clarification but they doubled down:

&gt;Hello, sorry for the inconvenience, we need to cooperate with the project team to complete the token name change. After the code is modified, we will restore it as soon as possible, and will also issue an announcement notice. Please pay attention to the follow-up announcement, or the status update of the deposit/withdrawal page. Thanks for your understanding.

That's obviously false. There is no code change to be completed. There wasn't even a code change a year ago (just a simple update of the ""Symbol"" property in the smart contract that doesn't affect anyone). There is no cooperation needed from the Paxos team.

You can see for yourself, the [Pax Dollar contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8e870d67f660d95d5be530380d0ec0bd388289e1) is functional and active. $USDP is fully active on other exchanges.

I don't know whether Huobi is having financial troubles or not, but at the very least, this should serve as a warning to users, Huobi could freeze any coin (even a basic ERC-20 stablecoin) for a prolonged time without a legit reason.

I keep my crypto on a hardware wallet, but wanted to trade during the market crash and unfortunately made a $USDP deposit just few days before it got completely frozen.",Is Huobi Insolvent?,10

Here's how it works.  

* use an api like plaid to get people's current spending/saving patterns
* build a predictive model that can predict how much saving a person will do in a given month(week? day?)
* issue 'saving challenges' that the models predict have a ~50% chance of success
* the company gets paid only when a user of the app _increases_ the dollar amount they saved beyond the baseline at signup, and then it's only a fraction of the increase

Lastly:

* use DCA visualization to show how these savings WOULD HAVE added up over time in bitcoin

Using an intermittent reward schedule like this is what makes apps addictive. If you can get people addicted to spending less and saving more, you'll have built a business that profits only when its customers do well, and earns that profit by helping them save in real money.

One of fiat's many crimes is that it convinced a generation of powerful central planners that a healthy economies require dysfunctional individuals who are incapable of saving.  Bitcoin can fix that.",request for startup: gamify saving in bitcoin,6

This mental model is not at all an accurate description or understanding of reality. It is trying to say that a person holds a Bitcoin only to dump it to someone else who is willing to pay more money for it. That view means that you do not understand that Bitcoin in itself was designed by Satoshi to be money.
And even if it is not used as money yet, in some places, that does not mean it never will.

But the real problem is that people do not act that way and even if it was true it could still go on for hundred and thousands of years,  every economist should know that. And if that turns out to be the case it actually makes those that stay outside and mock the fools while the fools have something to store their value. The real fools.

Most people who buy a bitcoin, will not sell all of it. Lets say they buy a bitcoin at $60.000 and it goes up to $120.000 in value.

Many people will not sell everything instead, if that is the case sell half and keep half. Since if they sold half, they have made their initial investment back and the coins they have are now just pure profit. 

This means that they stay in Bitcoin. And do not sell everything to the next ""bagholder"".

Another usecase is that many people who sell everything maybe because they need to buy something and the buyer will not accept bitcoins as payment, will come back once they have some money again to invest and store.

There is something that actually works 100% as a fools game and that is art and antiquites. Often only one person hold an artwork and that person sell that complete artwork to the next buyer who will not want to sell the whole of it, for less than what they bought it for.

And artwork can store their value for hundreds of years going from one person to another. Once it has been established as something valuable.

The same can and is could be likely to happen to Bitcoin. Once it has established that it can keep its value over a longer time, there will be more and more people willing to hold some. 

And when more and more people are willing to hold some, more and more will be willing to sell something in return for getting payed in bitcoins.

Bitcoin does not require a constant inflow of new holders to hold or gain in value over a longer period of time. All it requires is a somewhat constant amount of holders not willing to sell at a lower price than what they bought it for. It does not even require that the majority is able and willing to do so. 
As if a majority will panic and sell at a loss to the somewhat constant amount of long term supporters, those who sold at a loss will after a while go away and the majority of coins will end up in the possession of long term holders.

So for example if there are around a million long term holders at a time, and some sell everything they had for the same or higher to new holders who later sell everything to the holders who previously had sold but are now back there would be a constant amount of around a million holders.

If that happens those holders without knowing each other cooperate with each other and create a store of value and it could go on for generations.

And ""all it takes"" is for a more or less constant amount of people to become the owners of the majority of coins at times and being willing and able not sell at a loss.

If that happens, which is what seems to be happening. The fools are the people standing outside and laughing at the so called ""fools"" who keep storing their value in that weird thing they call Bitcoin.

And if Bitcoin is still here the next year and the year after that etc. There will be a growing number of people willing to hold it and trade it for something and if people begin to trade their bitcoins for goods and services directly instead of selling it only for fiat money, bitcoins will be moved of from the exchanges and the price will stabilize and increase.

As long as the majority of coins are still sold for fiat, the price of bitcoin will continue to fluctuate in the short and medium term but it could still increase in the long term for centuries or generations.

Though one should not invest more than one is willing to lose, as nothing is guaranteed. But I personally believe that Bitcoin is here to stay and that the majority of bitcoiners are holding and do not intend and plan to sell at a lower price than they got in, that would be a not very good plan.","""Bitcoin is a fools game""",0

Back around 2008-2010..

The US was barreling towards a recession‚Ä¶

Reddit didn‚Äôt exist, but we still had forums

One of my favorites was on MarketWatch. We were HODLers of gold. Physical

Anyways, the fiat $ was such a joke that the members created an event that we called FDIC Friday ! During the week we would individually read the news and markets and individually predict how many banks would the FDIC close at 6PM this Friday.

The winner who guessed correctly would win an ‚ÄúAs Seen on TV‚Äù chamWow ( a synthetic chamois). We would end up w too many correct guesses ! So, we had to change the rules. How many in which states.

Of course, we had haters. Gold is dead, it‚Äôs just a metal‚Ä¶.

Marketwatch shut us down lol

Maybe we should start an r/FDIC_Friday for BTC?

I am curious as to how people feel about the current BTC ecosystem as a whole. For context, I have been involved with bitcoin for \~5 years now and run my own node as a hobby. Recently I have become curious how we have allowed so many large systematic risks to creep into the system and become highly integrated to user experience and the association with bitcoin. While it should be highlighted that many coiners hold the ethos of self custody and will avoid putting trust in another entity at all costs. It is somewhat startling from a system standpoint as to how many large and integrated ambiguous trusted parties have become important to the system (ie tether, staking platforms, and many exchanges). I believe some of these risks likely pose even further systematic risk which could lead to reputational risk and harm the BTC user experience and adoption as a real tool for good.

Does anyone think there is anyway to really stop or at least decrease the importance of these things? Or was it just always going to occur when you give everyone free and open access to a means of exchange with rather low barriers to use. While it is hard to imagine Bitcoin as something that the majority of people speculate on the price, I think it is important to consider what new users think when they are first beginning to use/hold BTC as well as what people think of the community from the outside. I guess I don't see many people pointing out the hypocrisy of some of these trusted large entities in the bitcoin and overall crypto system and how they directly contradict  many of the reasons bitcoin was created (and tbh resemble a lot of what I thought we were working to avoid in the current financial framework).

I definitely am not just trying to just shitpost or spread fear and to be fair maybe in time all of this will get flushed out of the system with market based factors and bitcoin and core will continue to improve and develop like we all expect. I guess I am just curious if anyone else feels this way or maybe it is needed to be this way? Curious peoples thoughts and even if there is anything people can really do about it? I guess we will see how this goes hah",Curious on People's Thoughts on Overall Bitcoin Ecosystem,1

If more tech savvy than average people have managed to lose 15-20% of BTCs in existence how do you think the average person will fair? I mean most people are dumb, I would bet the IQ of the typical crypto investor is way way higher than average, and they still ended up collectively losing 10s of billions of dollars in BTC value.

The problem I see, is that Bitcoin and decentralized systems as a whole are mistake in intolerant, and humans unfortunately make mistakes.

Imagine in the future that people will be able to buy big things like say a house with BTC and thus save some commissions. However, because of the unforgiveness of the system, if you make a mistake in the transfer you basically just lost a house. Do you really think the average person will choose to take the risk to save on commissions?

Prove me wrong and change my mind!

**If someone here manages to convince me this isn't a problem for mass adoption I will buy some BTC again.**

Full disclosure: I mined a bit years ago.. sold it all at around 40k recently.

**Edit: got some interesting comments from some people and I am now convinced the estimated number of actually lost bitcoins I quoted is inflated. However, I haven't encountered convincing arguments for why mistake intolerance won't stand in the way of mass adoption. I just can't see the average person taking these risks on a daily basis. In addition, all solutions to this problem involve centralized systems which further casts doubt on the decentralization idea. Lastly, I find it sad that the most hostile responses got the most upvotes. I am guessing people are emotional because they are scared, which is understandable as the price can still drop much lower than it is now and the last all time high was the least impressive so far (only 3.5x).**",Change my mind: BTC has a problem with lost wallets (15-20% of mkt cap) and therefore will never be mass adopted,0

The other big killer is that you ABSOLUTELY do not want a deflationary currency.

The fact that bitcoin has a hard cap on the amount of currency that can be generated fucks it.

First there's an upper bound on the bitcoin can be mined.

Second there's a lower bound on the divisibility of bitcoin. Once you've made a Satoshi of a bitcoin (like a cent of a dollar) you can't go lower.

If something is worth 1.5 satoshis then someone gets screwed. Either the buyer pays an extra .5 satoshi or the seller loses .5 satoshi.

And again, deflationary currencies are a death knell. Why would I buy 10 loaves of bread today for 1 satoshi when I can buy 12 tomorrow? Why would I buy 12 loaves of bread tomorrow when 1 satoshi can buy 16 on Friday?

Deflation ends the velocity of money. I don't pay the bread baker they can't pay their workers or suppliers those workers can't pay rent those suppliers have to lay off workers etc. Etc. Etc.

‚ÄúLN has many, many issues. Copy pasting from another comment (not mine):

The concept has many fatal flaws that are well known and do not seem to be solvable. One of them is the lack of a reliable and efficient algorithm to find a viable payment path between two nodes that are not neighbors and don't have a common neighbor. In a reasonably distributed network with millions of users, it is expected that such a path will have many hops, say six or 20. For a path to be viable, all those channels must have enough capacity to send the amount in question. But since the state of the channels is constantly changing, that search would require a huge number of messages, either during it or in preparation to it.

Another problem is fraudulent channel closures. After doing a series of payments through a channel, you can try to close the channel, and collect its balance, as if those payments have not been made. Since no one knows about those payments except the two end nodes,it is up to the other node to scan the blockchain at least once a day, and promptly issue a ""punishment"" closure transaction if he sees such a fraudulent one, and hope that it does not get stuck in a backlog. But your punishment will be only the loss of the remaining channel capacity; so it is worth trying once you have made enough payments to almost exhaust the channel's capacity. Users who cannot afford to scan the blockchain (like all mobile users) would have to hire and trust the service of a ""watcher"", and send him a message after receiving each payment through the channel.

There are many ways in which the network could be gamed or sabotaged. For instance, you can negotiate a payment with a long chain of nodes, but drop out at the last moment. You will not pay anything for that attempt, but all those nodes would have to temporarily reserve the amount for you, until the negotiation times out. Repeat at will. The LN guys had decided to use a onion protocol for those negotiations, for privacy; but then the intermediate nodes will not know who you are and thus cannot blacklist you. (The may have given up on onion negotiations, but then all intermediate nodes will know how much you are paying to who. Unlike bitcoin addresses, LN nodes cannot be freely created, so the identity of users is much easier to establish.)

With a similar trick you can monitor all payments made through a channel anywhere in the network, or manipulate channel balances so as to force other nodes to take overly long routes, possibly through nodes that you control -- and that charge very high fees.

The LN concept assumes that nodes are mostly balanced. That is, over some given period -- a month, a week -- each user pays out through the LN as much as he receives through it. It cannot easily accomodate a frugal landlady who collects $1000 a month from her 50 tenants and spends only $2000 a month herself. Such unbalanced nodes would have to periodically send some of the excess money they receive to a ""bank"" or some sort; but then the bank may easly be unbalanced too.

Another big problem is that you must lock in advance enough coins into your channels to handle all sequences pf payments that you expect to make or receive through the LN. Thus there will be a lot of idle coins locked up in channels, not earning any interest.

In the original ""decenralized"" LN concept, each user ould have to open several channels, maybe half a dozen, to ensure that the network is well-connected. But if you have $600 locked into six channels, $100 each, you cannot send a payment greater than $100. If you want to pay $350, you would need at least 4 separate payments -- assuming that the receiver accepts piecemeal payments.

Some of those problems can be avoided if the network is centralized: there is one huge ""hub"" node, and every user has a single channel to it. But then, apart from the ""philosophical"" objections, the central hub will know all your payments,and can block them or overcharge for them. On the other hand, the hub would have to fund its outgoing channels with many times the total amount that users have locked into the incoming channels; and cannot use any of those funds for that.

And the LN will have all sorts of legal problems. In the US, if you offer your node to serve as middleman in multi-hop payments, you will probably be classified as a Money Transmission Service; you will need the proper license and you will need to verify the identity of senders and receivers of every payment, and report large or suspicious payments to the gov.

When you mention one of those problems to an LN promoter, he will say ""ah, but the LN will not be decentralized, it will be centralized""; or ""ah, but the LN will not be centralized, it will be decentralized"", according to the case. That is why they have always avoided to describe a specific scenario -- ""N users, K channels per user, M merchants, ... etc"" -- which people like me could use in a simulation, in which the LN would not immediately collapse.

The LN developers are aware of those problems, and don't have any idea of how to solve them. But that does not matter. Bitcoin promoters recruit their victims by telling them that bitcoin will be ""reserve currency of the world"", ""Visa killer"", ""replacement for the US dollar"" -- but always in a carefully unspecified future. So, the LN will ""work"" as long as the people at Lightning Labs claim that they are ""working"" on those problems, and promise that the network will be ready in that same unspecified future. And those devs will get paid their fat salaries long as the venture capital lasts.‚Äù",Please help me with these counter arguments of lightning network.,14

Many people in the responses thought that by ‚Äúhard‚Äù I was referring to the level of difficulty of the SHA-256 PoW problem needed to mine a block. This is NOT what I meant.

I meant hardness in the general economic sense. I.e., the difficulty of generating more of an asset, sometimes measured by the stock to flow ratio. 

The conclusion is that Bitcoin WILL indeed be 2x as hard an asset after May 2024, certirus paribus. Of course, this will not be the case as there are so many other variables at play, like the hashrate. 

This shows the importance of defining terminology to avoid misunderstandings. I did not mean hard in terms of Bitcoin‚Äôs difficulty adjustment level. I meant it in terms general economic difficulty of getting one more Bitcoin.

***

I know of course that the hashrate will not remain the same but this question is purely for understanding. 

Will 1 Bitcoin require twice as much electricity to obtain after the mining reward halves, assuming the hashrate remains the same? 

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to share that I've recently graduated college, and I will be beginning my career as a software engineer in August. I've been a Bitcoiner since about 2020, but I've never been able to obtain a full bitcoin because of various expenses like bills, tuition, etc. At one point after my internship last summer I was able to reach 0.60 BTC in my holdings but that number has unfortunately fallen to 0.25 because of the expenses I've mentioned. Since I will finally be earning my own full time income at a higher scale, I was just wondering if you guys could share some thoughts/opinions on how you would go about this bitcoin journey in the day and age that we are in if you were in my position. I'm not asking for financial advice, but I just want to hear some perspectives for me to get a better idea of what I should actually do.

As mentioned, as a software engineer, I will be earning just over 100K base salary with a signing bonus of 20k. It has been my goal to obtain as much bitcoin as I can in my lifetime, but with the volatility in price, I've had numerous chances (March 2020 at $3000, I could've sold at 68k and rebought at 19k this summer, etc), but I've just never been able to figure out what chance is mine. I've personally thought about **allocating 20% of my base salary into BTC (20k) and dollar cost averaging the 20k signing bonus** **($2500 weekly, over 8 weeks starting in August).** 

But again, with the volatility in price, there's not telling if by the end of this summer I'll even be able to obtain even 1 full BTC. This is why I'm curious as to what you guys would do. Would you just wait until Bitcoin reaches a certain price to buy? Would you also dollar cost average? Etc.? I'm interested to hear everyone else's opinions/ideas, and if you could please share what and why, that would be awesome. Hope to hear some good answers, thanks everyone.",Recent College Graduate and Upcoming Bitcoin Journey Questions,2

Sometimes these posts theorise the dollar is in decline and Bitcoin might be the new global reserve...suggesting huge potential growth in value...

However seldom do these posts of greed and hopium consider the other major contender for global monetary hegemony- Chinas digital Yuan, sometimes known as DCEP.

With China now dominating global mercantile production and trade China clearly intends to provision an alternative to the USD/SWIFT system of international banking settlement- and the digital Yuan is designed for this purpose. Greatly reduced costs and much increased speed of settlement seem likely, but more significant would be immunity from US sanctions.

Most nations are highly reliant upon Chinese trade for both imports of cheap mass produced goods and increasingly higher tech products- most of the USAs big techs rely upon Chinese assembly lines and many on Chinese technicians and AI.

Just as once USA dominated global manufacturing and trade, China increasingly occupies this role.

How many nations could afford to refuse if China required trade with it to be denominated in Yuan.

Obviously Bitcoin is an alternative which China and other BRICS and non aligned nations could adopt for USD free trade settlement but Bitcoin has so far not been received with much enthusiasm by the BRICS, rather more attempts to ban it.

So when considering future Bitcoin price prospects these speculations need to consider the likely shape of the future international monetary system. Will it remain dominated by USD and a relatively tolerant western attitude to Bitcoin, or will Chinese Yuan become dominant and seek to crush Bitcoin opportunities?

I don't think it is bad to buy the top because I don't think it can ever be bad to trade fiat for btc.  


Like Aleks Svetski said:  


""There is no safe place to park the product of your labor. There is no realm of integrity where the rules are not changed by some cabal of morons who think they can outcompete gravity.

Bitcoin is the only option, and while they attempt to financially engineer bombs to drop on markets, we grow stronger. We ‚Äú[fight in the shade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dienekes).‚Äù""  


So what do we do if we told our loved ones to buy at 69k?  


There is no good answer. If you fucked up like me, your family thinks you lost all their money and they have good reason to think they should never listen to your advice again. If they went all in, their net worth is now diminished.   


Just consider for a minute - what if bitcoin goes to 15k next? I know people who believe bitcoin could go to 10k or even as low as 3k. (Imagine Tone Vays was right after all). Don't get me wrong, to me the price is not relevant. I buy and I hold because I think bitcoin will go to 10 Million and beyond one day. And besides that, I buy and I hold because I want to help create an alternative. The fiat system destroyed our planet for decades. I am looking forward to decades of peace and prosperity based on sound money. That's my motivation for bitcoin, the 'gainz' are secondary.   


But your family might not believe in bitcoin as you do. They don't UNDERSTAND it as you do.  


Can you convince them through education?  
If they are fearful, they are emotional and irrational. It's going to be hard to sit down and explain the monetary history, right? Their mind will be occupied with only one thought WHERE IS MY MONEY??  


To be honest, there is no good answer to this, we fucked it up. So the only way forward, in my opinion, is humility. Ask for forgiveness. Admit your mistake. I was wrong, I'm a horrible trader, I was irrational, I gambled away your money. I'm deeply sorry.  


**The only way to regain trust is by being honest, transparent, and admitting mistakes.**  


After that, hopefully, you can sit down and explain bitcoin to your family until they understand that it doesn't matter too much at what price they bought. All that matters is that they DID buy SOME.  


And even more so, none of us will take bitcoin into the grave. Bitcoin is just money. But life is more than money and we should all remind ourselves about that.

If you haven't bought bitcoin at the top, I admire you. You can now start setting up a savings plan all the way down to whatever dollar value Bitcoin might go during the recession. On the way up, those you pulled onto the liferaft will be forever grateful.","Told my family to buy at 69k, here is how I convince them to HODL",0

I'm sure many of us recommend for people to dollar cost average extra money people are ok losing forever. Personally i'm going to do more to let people know that every dollar of BTC they buy is a dollar that can't be used by some of the larger forces against them in manipulation. BTC is the ultimate short squeeze and all we have to do is hold it. with maybe 2-3 million coins left, if the population of a large metropolis started buying literally 1 dollar a day, there is no way the manipulators could keep the market down. (LA for example has almost 4 million people in it) to this end I'm hoping anyone that reads this will let others know just how supply shock works so normal people can grab bitcoin.

So many of the issues he raised were due to the debasement of the dollar which we are seeing in real-time now. However, there were so many times when the fundamental problem could be solved by Bitcoin. The book was fascinating but by the end of it, besides all the human elements of the story, my thought was Bitcoin fixes this.  

I do not have a finance background but I am an avid reader. This is not the first book where this has occurred.

But the world where BTC would cost 1 million dollars( used as figure of speech in this context), would basically mean that dollars, euros and yen of the world have hyperinflated into inexistant reality. 

I always think about how much I would like pay for a burger in BTC and I don't arrive to any direct number without converting between usd or euros in middle. 

But few days ago, I was talking to one of my friend from Sri Lanka where the currencies have almost hyperinflated. 

He told me some quite revealing. He told me that when he talk with his family and when he basically ask what is the price of 1 kg rice, they give him ""x"" sri lankan rupees as an answer and he does the conversion in dollars/euros and say ohh it is ""y"" dollars now. 

But when he ask the same question in a month or so 1kg of rice is now costing ""2x"" now. This number doesn't make much sense to him now. So does the conversion of 2x to it roughly arrives at ""y"" dollars now. 

So, his reference is becoming ""y"" dollars for 1 kg of rice now. It doesn't matter what it cost in Sri Lankan rs as that number doesn't make sense to him anymore. 

This scenario is quite revealing that if the middle currency, in this case Sri Lankan rupees is losing it's value so fast that it doesn't matter to him how much it cost in Sri Lankan rupees anymore. He just now remember the price in dollar which is relatively stable. 

Now dollar is on the right track to be hyperinflated in few years. That is the reason I am now convinced that when 1 BTC would hit 1 million dollars (whenever it does), it won't matter, as USD would be getting hyper inflated anyways. 

That's is the day we will completely move to the real Bitcoin Standard and start pricing things in BTC directly.",BTC rising to levels of 1 million dollars won't mean much to us!!,11

Strike's awesome ability to teleport money to anyone in the world and exchange currencies for almost nothing in virtually no time, is almost worthless to those who don't already have a bank in their country.

Here's an example, I want to use Strike to send money to family in Haiti. Screw Western Union fees! So I tell my relative to set up on the Strike app. Great. Easy. I send them $100 USD. Strike converts it to the Haitian Gourde instantly. Awesome. Now they want to go buy food or supplies to fix the house. Sorry, cash only here. They're unbanked like 80% of the country so no way to withdraw that money. Therefore there's no point in using the service. It doesn't solve the problem because there's no last mile solution. 

Many countries have similar situations, El Salvador, being one of the most prominent. Am I missing something?

I do believe that it'll become the global currency standard in the futute, and that any other coin is doomed to fail in the long run.

However, I can't help but be concerned about one thing: the privacy of the transactions.

Anyone can see how much money you have and who you send to. Although wallets are pseudonymous, blockchain analysis' companies are getting better and better to determine the real identity of their owners. If this keeps up, those companies will have data about everyone's patrimony and spending habits. I don't think that this is healthy for a monetary system.

Given the situation with some exchanges having to stop withdraws gives the idea that some exchanges are fractional reserves. Does that mean there are some fake-bitcoin out there that exchanges have promised that don‚Äôt exist? I‚Äôve been thinking about the stock-to-flow ratio predictions. Of course, models are never the complete truth. Regardless, it is an interesting way to think about bitcoin price. If there is greater supply being bought and sold, then that would artificially increase the supply and artificially drive down price. So, not only is bitcoin on sale because of the bear market, but it is on sale because exchanges are being fraudulent. 

Any thoughts here?",Is the current purchasable supply of bitcoin higher than available bitcoin?,156

Bitcoin is alive! Large and small simultaneous changes in several independent software reinforce Bitcoin's robustness. Changes in measurement methodology reinforce some hypotheses.

**Keywords**  
Tor, IPv4, IPv6, CJDNS, ASNs, Countries, User Agents, Block statistics, Network speed, Measurement methodology.

**Introduction**  
Some time ago I wrote ([post1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/tgkpmi/german_bitcoin_nodes_keep_migrating_to_tor_after/) and [post2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/uzna2l/tor_update_047the_first_stable_version_of_tor/)) trying to correlate certain data around Tor. Today I will try to continue tying the dots.

**Background**  
**April 25:** Bitcoin Core v23.0 is released. It changes the way it connects peers.

Highlights:

* Optimizes management of nodes known to the network *""with the intention of reducing ""address black holes""* [\#21528](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21528)
* Port 8333 loses preference and it is now possible to connect to nodes using non-conventional ports. [\#23542](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23542) [\#23306](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23306)
* [CJDNS](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/doc/Whitepaper.md), a further step towards automatic and cryptographically secure nodes at the protocol level[\#23077](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23077)

[23.0 release notes](https://preview.redd.it/dfzagtr9vz791.png?width=403&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d240a5fc310475582ffa1c5e94a00087e3eb9e0)

**May 4:** Tor has released 0.4.7.7, the first stable Tor release with support for [congestion control](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/uzna2l/tor_update_047the_first_stable_version_of_tor/). Congestion control will result in significant performance improvements in Tor, once Exit relays upgrade.

Highlights:

* The network speed has been steadily increasing. It remains to check the 0.4.7.7 effect.

[Network speed](https://preview.redd.it/pxy8pgg320891.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d418fb355ea40230397423864a8d040e60c6daf)

**May 28:** Bitnodes.io changes its ""Block Heights"" measurement methodology. This does not change the performance of the network, we just now have more up-to-date snapshots. 

Highlights:

* \~98% of nodes are up to 2 blocks away from the tip. Previously we knew it was \~70%.

[bitnodes.io commit 6de95325b](https://preview.redd.it/0qfk371szz791.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d39cb3fb9878ec859ccb4a1c458978c096dbbf3)

[Block heights](https://preview.redd.it/96534j3qvz791.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ad0446e48dfb76fbc9f4a1784e0f07b99bded59)

**May 29:** a large number of nodes (\~300) appear from the ASN AS396982/Google.

[ASNs](https://preview.redd.it/asfbbjeyvz791.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=088c1017afdf3244d15cafb925fcd0aef8c30dd9)

[AS396982\/Google](https://preview.redd.it/kd9iwgl1wz791.png?width=765&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2266c9677d43f5adb816adee4fbb301a8d20cbc)

On the same date also \~300 nodes version 0.20.1 burst. The image shows the stable upward adoption of 23.0 and the ""new"" 0.20.1 and the disappearance of 0.20.0.

[23.0 vs 0.20.1 vs 0.20.0](https://preview.redd.it/b87i4z58wz791.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b92cbc93c2439d32e7dff1f5e40a92a30ce01837)

**June 3:** a new section of bitnodes.io is made public: Global Nodes, including both reachable and unreachable nodes. And it is consistent with measurements by [other authors](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/historical.html).

Highlights:

* The method of this report can only provide a rough estimation.
* (We may also be less than we think)

[Global bitcoin nodes on bitnodes.io](https://preview.redd.it/qjtib5odwz791.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b12a793b49d8fc8bd7fa6eb847a75cee13b12dd1)

I think [this would answer](https://twitter.com/port8333/status/1540820386249510912) the question [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/vkbw94/number_of_nodes_has_exploded_the_last_few_days/).

&gt;*Multiple nodes from the same IP address, but different port numbers are counted as one node in this report. A larger window size may increase the likelihood of the same node being counted more than once due to e.g. IP lease renewal.*

[500k nodes?!](https://preview.redd.it/c3s7hkahwz791.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fac6787c7b0afab05a2492f42cbd8157c3a859ef)

[Looking for a fix](https://preview.redd.it/kytzpihiwz791.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbd548f2c969e15882ce7f34b2aecd349f65ecb3)

**Interpretation**  
I need help in this section. Given the decentralized and voluntary nature and the large amount of information that is published and reviewed, it is not possible for me to conclude anything at all. The speed of information and simultaneous changes wreak havoc on my method of analysis, lacking order and discipline, so it could very well all be associated with coincidences. Even as I write this the information changes or I myself interpret it differently. If all or parts do not make sense, please correct me.

However, one thing is for sure: as the network grows I tend to discard the idea of countries or borders and that despite how fast we are going, it still seems early days!

Also, I can't quite grasp the CJDNS network, could it be the gateway to a society of autonomous machines and the resulting Terminators?

**Prediction**  
Bitcoin will be considered (or be part of) a living organism. At the level of protocol and interactions it is similar to physiological functions and maintenance of homeostasis.

They happen to be the most advanced creatures in the universe(these guys can solve a chess position by simply looking at it), and they transact in FUcoin.  It's basically a much, much better and more advanced decentralized digital currency like Bitcoin, but far better(it's faster, it works anywhere you just need a telescope and it's fiber-croptic).  And they demand goods and services from earth, and in exchange they will pay us in the universe reserve currency, the FUcoin.  And they run large deficits in FUcoin.  Because they have the Universe's biggest military and they have to spend a lot on military spending and also on transfer payments for their old and medically challenged creatures.

So we can either take on the universe's largest military (LOSE), or try to get on board with FUcoin and accumulate it so we have the universe reserve currency and can buy things from other Galaxies that we need and can't produce ourselves.

What about Bitcoin then?  Will it survive?  Or will everyone just switch to FUcoin and we're kinda screwed?  Just thinking it out.","***THIS COULD MAKE BITCOIN GO TO ZERO*** What if heavily advanced space aliens show up, and demand that earth pay them like a good colony, and their currency is a more advanced version of Bitcoin???

I HODL for now, planning on doing that in the future too. 

However, I dont understand the halving thing, so im asking for a ELI5 (explain like im 5). 

I know about the halving and that you can only mine 6.25 bitcoin right now every 10 minutes (for each block as a reward). In 2024 there will be 3.125 and so on... 

What I do not understand is, that there is new mining-tech every year and stuff gets faster ( for example the new GTX 3090 are way better than the Graphic cards in lets say 2018). 

So why wouldnt you be able to mine at a faster rate in 2024, than you are now? 

Like when you can mine 6.25 Bitcoin with todays hardware, maybe you can mine in twice the speed in a few years, even if you only get 3.125 every block. 

So please explain briefly why the FIAT-Value of Bitcoin has to spike upwards after 2024/2028/2032 and so on. (duh, less bitcoins for every block BUT HOW EXACTLY DOES THAT WORK)

Is Mining like a Lottery? Like some random Miner gets the reward?   
Whatever, since im too stupid for Mining I will just stick with buying.

Have a nice day!",ELI5 this Question about Bitcoin,0

I did my neurotic 4 times a day paypal check today and &lt;--&gt; transfer button was there.  I transferred all of it to another wallet.  .44 usd fee.  Took about 10 minutes to show.  They warned it could take two hours.  There were two text messages to confirm my identity during the process.  


I don't have a comment on the fees and bid ask shenanigans on buying..  I was able to withdraw bitcoin from paypal.

So not the typical 51% attack. But rich countries ( maybe China or USA, maybe exspecially USA because they have hundred of tousends btc and crypto already confiscated) or rich people could attack bitcoin with mempool flooding and it would be much more easier and cheaper to do than something like a 51% attack. So Just make transactions with very high fees that the miner will priority their transactions and the normal one are Stuck weeks or month and the chain would be useless for normal people for month. Because of the reason you wouldnt even know which high fee would be an attack or which would Just be a guy who want to have it done fast makes it realy hard i think. And would the miners be more like defender and would say it is strange to have that many high fees so it is likely an attack and let lower fee transaction pass or would they Just work for their own pockets and ""sell"" the network to the attackers as long as the money comes in.

Like most of you I'm pretty done hearing all the price predictions. The price will fluctuate. The end. The only thing that does seem extremely bullish to me acutely is the approval of a spot ETF. So predictions aside, the approval of a spot ETF will necessarily mean a massive influx of capital into BTC (as long the ETF host actually goes into the market and purchases the appropriate amount of BTC), correct?  And from what I've seen, tentative approval of spot ETF could be as early as June 29. 

I'm not asking for a price prediction, because no one can predict what other sellers will do in an environment that is potentially being pumped by the massive purchases of a spot etf. But unless I'm missing something, the spot ETF's WILL mean A LOT of purchases. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, or if I'm not accounting for something.",Spot ETF,0

Now my only concern is where and how to store my private keys. I understand that I need at least 2 geographic locations, but should I really trust a bank safe deposit box?

I'm a renter living in NYC so I don't like the idea of having a paper copy in my apartment. 

I was thinking of using 3 different locations: my apartment, a bank safe deposit box, and self storage unit. 

I know I'm not supposed to store the keys digitally, but what if I take my computer offline, create a file on an encrypted drive that is also offline and stays offline, and use that as one copy for my keys? 

I would then keep this hard drive in my safe deposit box and storage unit. That way if anyone every  gained access to the safe deposit box or storage unit (which happens all the time, several articles online explain how), then they wouldn't be able to access the files and see my private keys.

It just seems dangerous to keep a paper copy out of my control because of all the worst case scenario chances of someone finding it. Or am I just being too paranoid?",Where and how to store private keys?,29

And yet, at least for now BTC is flooring where we might expect at previous ATH. There are plenty of ""Bitcoin is dead"" / Crypto is dead sentiments across mainstream media worldwide.

But, **the weakest hands have liquidated**. Some of us here need the cash and are selling, sure, but the bigger investors, traders, and speculators who have any intention of selling have already done so (bringing us to where we are today).

Shitcoins are dying here and there, but I think the smart folks will probably move to the one and only real cryptocurrency, bolstering BTC dominance and proving BTC as the hardest money.

My theory is that since the weakest hands have liquidated we very well may soon start seeing small price increases. Sure, I could be totally wrong, we could be here for years and dip lower and maintain lower, we've been here before so that's a possibility.

But I'm thinking that with supply as low as it is and with as much larger the Bitcoin community is than it was in 2017 --&gt; 2019, there is enough organic retail demand to eat up the supply.

If indeed we can maintain and even increase price a little, I think it may pique the interest of more retail investors as well as the institutions to say, ""You know what? We've seen this story before... Bitcoin is on the rise again, let's get back in"". And we have seen this before.

**But** when we've seen this before

(1) supply was higher, the rate of mining was higher

(2) demand was lower, smaller user base

(3) most critically, Bitcoin was FAR less known. Today you ask anyone on the street and they've heard of Bitcoin. Better yet, you ask them about it and they probably know it's ""dead"" and crashed. This point specifically is why **when** Bitcoin turns and starts rising again people will remember that it was ""dead"" and wonder what's going on.

Yes, enthusiasts and those of us who have been paying attention for years know that Bitcoin is declared dead regularly. But the masses don't. Between 2012 and 2019, 90% of these regular folks hadn't heard of Bitcoin, let alone hearing that it had ""died"" already.

Today, most people know that Bitcoin is dead. And when they hear that Bitcoin is no longer dead, it might convince them of its value.

(4) lack of accessibility. In the past, you had to go create an account at an exchange, KYC verify with pictures of ID's, wait on approvals, wait 5 days for ACH to go through, etc. This is an extremely high burden. Today, anyone with cash app or paypal can at least get **exposure** to Bitcoin. (Yeah yeah, not your keys, I'm with you on all of that but it's a different conversation).

&amp;#x200B;

**Admittedly,** it's a bit of a long shot. I don't really actually anticipate this occurring. But **if** it did, during this worldwide economic catastrophe, it would be the perfect storm to actually decouple Bitcoin from traditional markets. I can dream.",A dose of hopium why Bitcoin may recover sooner rather than later.,0

Just a wild wierd thought that came across. I know it is a one in a ""78 digit number"" probability to guess a 24 word combination and if one embarks on it, it will take decades to run all combinations with the current computing power we have. 

But what if:

Some geek like Satoshi creates a new network/protocol which can be downloaded by ""breakers"" around the world and just like miners, use all the computing power available with them, to run the network. The protocol through bigdata/blockchain keeps track of all word combinations attempted by ""breakers"". Imagine a million ""breakers"" join this and run the network. Imagine special hardware is made to run this brute force. Imagine huge farms run these brute force. So we don't have to wait for quantum computing to arrive but we create voluminous rigs that with combined computing power, try to achieve what a quantum computer can achieve. Now it is not trying to find one wallet from a 10 power 78 wallets. With adoption down the line, there may be some hundred million wallets holding bitcoin. So the probability to hit a valid wallet is also increasing with adoption. And the ""breakers"" will also increase with time, increasing the hash rate of brute force. Hardware efficiency will as well increase with time. With bitcoin increasing in price, it is all the more reason for more breakers and more hardware to join this. 

I don't fear losing my wallet to this but is it such a case that someone somewhere loses a wallet every week and hence bitcoin becomes less trust worthy?

That is, status quo  (e.g. fiat) is so engrained in their mind that they have a hard time imagining how things could be different and/or they have a vested interest in things not being different (e.g. savings/income sources in fiat). Everyone is susceptible to this bias, including myself, but there is a simple trick that can help.

Let's say you are evaluating an innovation (Bitcoin). The trick consists in a thought experiment where you imagine a world where the status quo (fiat) and the innovation (Bitcoin) are reversed.

In this thought experiment, Bitcoin is the status quo. Everyone has a Bitcoin wallet (or LN wallet), transactions are can't be censored, everything is priced in BTC, no one can control the money supply, etc. But back in 2008, some smart guy in his basement came up with the idea of the US dollar. A centralized currency whose supply is controlled by the US government. Self-custody requires hoarding pieces of paper. Electronic transactions require contracting the services of private companies called banks.

In that world, what chances are that the population will abandon Bitcoin in favor of this new currency, the US dollar? I'd say the chances are slim. The point of this thought experiment is really to show how much of a role status quo plays in the success of fiat. I'd say it is a LOT. And I believe that as more people realize the benefits of Bitcoin, this will slowly but surely change.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",Overcoming status quo bias (or why Bitcoin will win in the long term),53

‚ÄúBitcoin finds itself in a place where yes, it consumes energy, but it‚Äôs far more efficient than all alternatives because people are not good at realizing forgone alternatives in economics.  

If someone gets interested in bitcoin and then they start buying bitcoin, well where did they get the money from? Well, they got it from working or earning it somehow, and there was an alternative, what they would have done with it before.  And bitcoin tends to encourage people to save because it‚Äôs gone up in value historically, or to take a longer term outlook, giving you hope for the future let‚Äôs say.  And so, they engage in longer term behaviors, and so actually they probably end up using less natural resources because they stop buying consumer gadgets that end up in landfills, they get more hesitant to spend money, or when they do spend money they want to spend it on things that are going to last a long time.  

So you know, there are foregone alternatives to everything.  A lot of the media reactions are not even good at capturing first order effects, but I think it is actually highly efficient and then it also comes to the point we discussed where with a fiat currency, which is a variant of proof of stake basically, the same energy is expended, it‚Äôs just expended in unproductive, and messy, and corruption prone ways.  But, the game theory is there so the money is going to be spent on lobbying or corruption or violence, criminality, you name it, it‚Äôs all happening day to day.  And everybody who‚Äôs got much real policy understanding of how the world works, realizes that this is the current state of the art which is pretty ugly and chaotic.  So I think if bitcoin provides a tidy solution to that, the electrical cost is actually much cheaper than the alternative.‚Äù",Adam Back on Bitcoin‚Äôs Energy Usage,44

Like some of you, I am trying to make money with cryptocurrencies. Yet, I am still learning the ropes and ""paying for my education"", so to speak.

So last week, amidst the chaos during the down towards the 17K level, I was shorting leveraged on Binance. I was opening and closing shorts locking some gains, up to the point I had a short position opened, didn't have a stop loss strategy and order, and Bitcoin turned up.

I do trust Bitcoin, and was just trying to make money out of the movements that day, but I got caught and my position went to loss. I didn't panic and closed at loss, since I still believe we didn't hit the bottom, so I am letting it ride for now. My entry price is 17900. I am currently at -160% loss, and added more USDT as collateral, trying to survive what I am still hoping is a dead cat bounce/bull trap. My liquidation price at the moment is 24724.

So yeah, I am trying to learn from my mistakes here, and at the same time trying to not lose money or minimize loss. This is money I can lose (I have this lesson to the heart) but I would prefer not to lose it. So I wanted to ask you, were you in my place, what would you do?

\- Cut your losses (that would be about 2000 USD right now, with still 800 as collateral available);

\- Keep the position open and collateral as is, hoping we eventually go back to 17K levels before reaching my liquidation price, and close the position with lowest loss possible;

\- Add more collateral to stay afloat longer

Thank you for your attention!

P.S.: I understand some of you may think this is deserved, and mock me for my mistakes, and that's alright.",A cautionary tale and asking for help,0

They are based in China and the current sale prices were worth a punt for me so I went for it:  https://shop.canaan.io

The total calculated costs are below:

2 x A1126 $1,320.00 USD 
Subtotal: $2,640.00 USD
Shipping Charges &amp; Insurance: $530.38 USD
Total: $3,170.38 USD (approx ¬£2577 GBP)

Import fees once reaching the UK: 
UPS brokerage ¬£12.74
Government charges: ¬£509.69
Total ¬£522.43

Grand total: ¬£3099.43 

So the total charges at customs worked out at about 20% of the total purchase + shipping cost.

forgot to add money laundering up there too. What are some actual legit uses for btc? I don't really consider investment an actual use if you know what I mean.

I'm asking out of genuine curiosity, no attitude or bad vibes intended.

Only legit use of it I can think of is sending money to relatives in another country, but even then you are most likely bypassing international money transfer regulations or something. 

Using it is kind of a pain in the ass, I'd rather just use apple pay or zelle for basically any transaction in my daily life.",What are the uses for btc outside of buying drugs and gambling deposits? Like actual legit and legal uses.,0

You send an internet request to a bitcoin bank with your public key that is your account identifier, they create your account in their database. The bank identifier is the bank public key, they signed their bitcoin deposit address with their private key to guarantee its theirs. You can deposit bitcoin on the bank by generating a bitcoin transaction and sending the bitcoin transaction to the bank before you send it to the bitcoin network so they know the money coming to them has to be credited to your bank account. Once you have money in the bank account you can sign a message with your bank account private key : ""send 10 sat to user with account identifier X\_2 in bank with identifier Z\_2"". You send that message to your bank, then the bank sign the message : ""Me bank Z\_1 tell you that my client X\_1 send 10 sat to your client X\_2 in your bank that is Z\_2"". The bank Z\_2 then credit the user X\_2. Every 10 minutes the banks settle themselves on the blockchain the difference between the total money they received from other bank users and the money they sent to other bank users.

This could scale Bitcoin to an infinite number of transactions with almost no fee and instant payments, the banks could settle with first layer or lightning to be even faster. I would prefer everybody to own their own keys but if Bitcoin grows to more than 150 million users it could allow scaling Bitcoin beyond 150M users.

Of course the banks could seize the bank users money but we could create a wallet interface where you can split your holdings in 100 different banks that use the same open source protocol to diversify custodial risk.",Open source Bitcoin banking protocol,1

We believe that the combination of an innovative spirit and strong community partnership allows the Company to achieve best-in-class execution and create successful outcomes.

We have recently adopted a new set of company values to commit to, one of them being transparency. Being a public company, there are many instances where we would love to reply to all of our retail investors. However, due to various legal and practical challenges, replying to every reasonable question that we are asked just hasn't been viable.

Starting now, we would love to bolster our efforts in this regard and start answering more and more questions from the retail community. We value your continued support and want all shareholders to feel confident in their investment.

Please submit any questions you have for Riot down below before the first of July. They can be about anything relevant! The proxy vote, our direction, and general questions about our business or bitcoin mining.

Our target date for an initial response is currently July 8th! We need time to allow several members of our team to provide input on our responses.

We intend to post a video response, potentially several depending on the number of questions posed, featuring Jason Les, CEO of Riot Blockchain. If scheduling conflicts occur, a text document answering selected questions will be posted instead.

As with any AMA, Riot reserves the right to select from the pool of questions. Keep them reasonable and please remain cordial!

We are excited to become a more active part of the retail Reddit community and hope to hear from everyone!

A friend recently told me that he thinks bitcoin was actually developed by the NSA because it‚Äôs the perfect way to track all transactions. Once one has the Blockchain, one can trace back all transactions to their owners.

I‚Äôve heard that bitcoin is anonymous, that if you have bitcoin and spend it on something then there‚Äôs no way for anyone to know who bought whatever it is.

After my friend‚Äôs assertion , I thought about it a bit. I seems to me that if I buy bitcoin, say by credit card, that purchase transaction goes on the blockchain, and there‚Äôs some sort of a link from the transaction to my credit card (whoever I bought it from has that link).

If I then spend some bitcoin, then wouldn‚Äôt the new blockchain transaction be traceable back to my original transaction, then back to my credit card? So theoretically back to me?

Blockchain technology, which lies at the heart of Bitcoin, continues to be an esoteric concept for most people. As a random sample, if you ask 10 people to explain blockchain in one simple sentence, 9 out of 10 will probably fail to answer. Lack of education about how Bitcoin works and why it is fundamental to a transparent global financial system makes people wary of investing in crypto.

**Not Backed by Central Banks**

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by design are decentralized smart contracts. A central bank does not issue or guarantee a Bitcoin. This scares off a large number of people who have been born and brought up with the belief that any piece of paper or a digital token becomes money (legal tender) only when it is backed by a country‚Äôs government and its central bank.

**High Volatility of Crypto**

Cryptocurrencies, led by Bitcoin, are perceived as a highly volatile investment marked by significant price fluctuations. Most people do not realize that any non-traditional, alternative asset that breaks free from the past and promises to revolutionize the future is going to be volatile by nature until it gets integrated into the mainstream.

When Galileo said that the earth moves around the sun, no one was ready to believe him. But over time it became a universal fact. The same holds true for every life-altering idea, including Bitcoin.

From those layer two solution the LN is the most popular. In my experience there is not much talk about the LN on this sub, although it could (in my eyes) drive crazy adoption. Is there a reason for this? Or do we keep a nice boundary between here and the LN sub?

The total landmass of the World is about 149.000.000 km2. This number devided by 21.000.000 results in round about 7 km2.
So you could say that owning a Bitcoin is about as rare as owning a plot of land with the size of 7 km2.

I am working on a mining farm that was using 30MW/h at its peak. Now mining is a more and more difficult type of business in my country and may shut down forever. What do you think is a new way of making a profit from a 30MW mining farm if mining dies?

I have a dream that all of these ASICs will be used to support Artificial Intelligence as it also requires operating servers. I know it is impossible to change ASICs, but maybe the farm can be used as a data centre for these types of servers.

I have been interested in Crypto. Currently, I am between Gemini &amp; FTX. I started the process with Gemini but halted since they asked me for a bank statement. I was not comfortable since it contains personal transactions and account balance. Instead, I provided a bank confirmation and a direct deposit form, which shows proof of account. However, Gemini wrote me that they still needed a bank statement. I asked them why and to provide a valid reason for it. Their response was the following:

*‚ÄúIndeed, we must comply with laws and regulations regarding the country you are registering from. That's why we must confirm your source of wealth and you source of funds. That's why we need to know your expected account activity. A bank statement will help us confirm your expected funding volume.‚Äù*

Is this normal? Or is there something out of place?

This is the reason why that I am searching for others exchanges and saw FTX US. I look up for their process and seems more flexible. Do you think I should go with them (FTX US)? Are there any other things I should know?

Thanks in Advance.",Gemini V. FTX US,1

This is why I don't see a situation where the USD doesn't go hyper in the next 24 months. Debt, inflation, and interest rates already have the USD trapped in a vortex that's effectively inescapable (Robert Triffin predicted this eventuality in the 60s), but blunting foreign demand of Treasuries, and blurring the petrodollar with something like this BRIC reserve is the straw that will do the breaking, accelerating the time frame from managed decline to a more sudden reality. If you're watching the DXY's incredible strength (has been on a relentless uptrend since January 2021), you might imagine an engine knocking, or the Weimar papiermark--which is to say volatility before the break. The papiermark gained dramatically against gold at times in the decade it took for the parabola of its hyperinflation to complete. Most thought it was a straight line. False. It was extreme volatility. Now replace gold with BTC and the papiermark with the USD on this chart. Where are we relationally?

I'd predict that the velocity of bitcoin's appreciation when the DXY starts falling again will be rather shocking. It's just another reason why I won't budge from my seemingly absurd price target in early 2023 that many of you have given me grief over üòå. And if bitcoin does break correlation with the Nasdaq at any point, then that would be a historic pivot that should send a shiver down your spine, and it means the capital flight release valve is opening somewhere and trying to be quiet, as big money hedges something quite dark. Also remember, stablecoins only work if the underlying currency pegging them is stable. If not, there's only one place in the entire ""currency"" space for them to go: ‚Çø.

Of course, if is a DECENTRALIZED Crypto Card, obviously the payment method cannot be converted from BTC from USD, for example, because to make a direct conversion, it would need an intermediary agent, taking away the proposal of decentralization.

What I have in mind would be a card that would access your wallet information (for this to happen, the card would probably have to be pre-build with your information embedded in it) and perform the currency transfer (BTC, for example) to the seller.

I'm not considering the consequences this would generate, just wondering if it would be possible to exist.

Inflation, or our money divided by the will-to-print-money by governing bodies, is hard to understand because infinity is a  difficult concept to grasp. It is abstract and humans don't understand large numbers. There has been no evolutionary need for us to understand large numbers.  


An edge-less abyss is scary. The evil effect, if not indeed the evil intention, implied by the practice of systemic inflation is hard for most of us to accept and still function socially, so we choose to ignore it.

&amp;#x200B;

Also,  the choice between a provably scare unit of account (Bitcoin) and a provably unaccountable unit of account (Fiat) forces us to face the terrifying truth that we are responsible for giving existence meaning (rather than  the Church, etc. doing so for us) and, honestly, most of us do not wish to look beyond our sandbox-reality. We wish to be coddled.   


Bitcoin  favors the atheist mindset of those who take responsibility for their  existential condition based on evidence-based observation, based on what can be counted and proven.

All I mean is that it‚Äôs time to start nailing predictions to a point where people believe that you are a psychic.  

This is extremely easy just take a few seconds to let this all sink in. 

A lot of people would have guessed that the price of bitcoin would have gone above $100,000 by now.

One of the main reasons that many people would have guessed that the price would be higher is due to the fact that governments around the world have printed lots of money over the last couple of years.

Therein lies the secret to investing in bitcoin.

When the overwhelming majority believe that a certain crypto outcome is inevitable, it is never the case.

It‚Äôs usually the opposite. 

When we were in the $60,000 range, the overwhelming majority believed that we would go higher. We did not.

During the previous bear market, the overwhelming majority believed that the bear market would be shorter, and the bottom was $10,000. They were wrong, it was much longer than people anticipated, and the bottom was right around $4000. 

So what does the majority believe now? The majority of people believe that we probably have bottomed out around the most recent low.

What does this mean? Very simple. 

They are guaranteed to be wrong. We are going much lower. POTENTIALLY to zero.

Virtually 0% of people who have exposure to crypto believe that Bitcoin will go to zero. 

Therefore, I‚Äôm starting to give scenarios where Bitcoin can go to zero a more serious look.","Let‚Äôs finally get this one right guys, easy üí∏.",0

I was on the r/cryptocurrency subreddit and came across this exchange (see below in quote blocks). I was under the impression that even if mining became centralized that it would still be in the best interest of the entity who controls the majority of the hash rate to protect the network as the opportunity cost to attack would be very high and thus disincentivize any attacks. However, if say a single entity controlled 51% of the Bitcoin networks hash rate and they were located in a country very hostile to Bitcoin would it be possible for the government of said country to order that entity to do nefarious things to the chain even if it's not in the financial interest of that entity?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\-This is what happened in the last cycle, mining just got more centralized, and the big players bought the little players equipment

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\- But I thought everyone in Camp Bitcoin said PoW was the most decentralized it could be??

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\-  No it doesn‚Äôt. BTC‚Äôs decentralization comes from the node validators, not the miners

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\-Thats a false and dangerous narrative. If most hashrate comes from regulated mining-corps and they are forced by the government to start censoring transactions it doesn't matter how  many nodes you have, the chain will be censored.

I know that addresses are supposed to star with 1bc or 3bc.

I was donating money through bitpay (who has no apparent customer service BTW) and because i use Nunchuk they did not have my wallet in their dropdown selection.

I made a donation, anyway and even though the QR code didn't scan, I used the address. 

It looked weird to me because it was not normal format. it started with

18GodPjqiRKb47.......

The payment went through. it was only meant to be $15 with $.07 in fees.

The change address is listed as having $85.70.

That is how much was charged to my wallet.

I understand that this is the cost of education but I am not sure what happened (aside from disregarding my awareness of the wonky address) and would love to know how this amount flowed out of my wallet without approval of that amount and if there is any way to block the transaction. So far there is 1 confirmation. I immediately pulled all a duplicate transaction out of my wallet with a higher transaction fee with the hopes that the double spend would beat out the first transaction and cancel out the cost of it. I read that here : [https://cryptostaunch.com/bitcoin-unconfirmed-transactions.html](https://cryptostaunch.com/bitcoin-unconfirmed-transactions.html)

But I really want to know if that was a hacked address/webpage/browser or if that was a bitpay thing that they do or what?

Crypto hardware wallet maker Ledger and global venture capital firm Cathay Innovation have teamed up to launch a ‚Ç¨100 million ($110 million) fund to invest in web3 startups.

The fund, dubbed Ledger Cathay Capital, is backed by the French public investment bank Bpifrance.

Ledger Cathay Capital will invest in early-stage startups across areas such as decentralized finance, security, infrastructure and digital ownership technologies. 

When asked why the fund was being launched now? Barrier said Ledger Cathay Capital sees web3 as a ""multi-decade investment opportunity"" and that the space is still evolving. She believe that the current environment is a real opportunity to start the fund and actively invest in the world's crypto startups.

Ledger chairman and CEO Pascal Gauthier concurred, saying that the fund will actively invest in startups building the decentralized future for the next billion users.

Ledger and Cathay Innovation are not new to each other. The VC firm has invested in Ledger's three funding rounds, including its latest $380 million Series C.

For the new fund, Ledger and Cathay Innovation will combine their expertise to source and assess investment opportunities, manage by Cathay Innovation. 

The fund will back both equity and token deals, with average check sizes in the range of $550,000 to $4.3 million. Targets creating 20-25 portfolio companies and expects to fully deploy in the next two to three years.",Ledger and VC firm Cathay Innovation launch $110 million crypto fund,3

The panel size is 9.6 kW, which produces 1,117 kWh/month **assuming full sun**. According to my last bill, I consume around 590 kWh within a summer month.

My monthly electrical bill is around $252.06 and the monthly cost of the Tesla system in a loan is $353.06/month for 10 years.

An S19 Pro Miner costs $5,940 to buy and yields $273.60/month assuming a 2.00% Pool Fee.

Since I have limited ""free capacity"" before I begin pulling from the grid at unprofitable rates, I can only mine for a limited amount of time per day. At 527 kWh/month of free capacity and a 3.250 kW Power requirement on the Miner, I can only mine 22.5% of the time (about 5.4 hours per day).

**How much would I make?**  
At 22.5% efficiency and revenue of $273.60/month, that's $61.56/month in mining profits. That doesn't sound like much.

**How much would the utility reimburse me for the ""free"" 527 kWh I put back into the grid each month?**  
Turns out, it's about $0.03/kWh so only $15.81/month. So definitely less than bitcoin mining. That‚Äôs great, but I spent $5,940 on the Miner.

**What‚Äôs my return on investment assuming no change in bitcoin price or mining difficulty adjustment?**  
$5,940/$61.56/month would take 8 years to pay off the Miner. 8 years is a long time in bitcoin world.

**Wouldn‚Äôt it just be better to put that Miner investment of $5,940 in bitcoin today¬†and secure $15.81/month in NEM?**  
You tell me.

EDIT:

Ran the same calculations, but for an S9J Miner on Newegg:

* S9 Cost: $385.90
* S9 Revenue: $37.80/month with 2.00% Pool Fee
* Profit: $8.05/month at 22.5% on-time
* ROI: 4 years",Is it Reasonable to Mine Bitcoin from Solar on Your Home?,25

However the underlying network and monetary system is incredibly steady and predictable. I think it's safe to say that most of you here already agree with that. 

As a thought experiment, I wanted to start a discussion about what kinds of business would (a) be able to operate only using Bitcoin, and (b) how feasible that would actually be, today. 

A supply chain would have to be okay pricing things in BTC (risky) but could sign contracts pegging the value of the product and components to the Bitcoin issuance schedule. 

For example, a barber. At Moon Moths barber shop, a standard haircut is 10000 sats. It doesn't matter what the ticker says about BTCs value in dollars. The cut is 10000 sats. 

The details for how this kind of business would survive solely on Bitcoin are important but innumerable. And they all require each link in the supply chain to agree to transact with Bitcoin. No small feat, and not legal in most places. Paying tax on everything would be a point where a conversion to the government's fiat is required (or other legal tender). So barring that piece...

I am still new to understanding the technical side of it, but here are my takeaways:

1) The concern about mining centrality is overblown, as it has been proven before that nodes ultimately determine what happens with network direction.

2) The analysis of nodes relevant for consensus was confusing to me - it seemed like they were making the argument that miner nodes and public nodes were relevant for consensus and most nodes didn‚Äôt communicate widely enough to enforce consensus.

3) The most valid concern seemed to be in the Sybil attack, although that seems like it isn‚Äôt a consensus risk but more of a short term transaction routing risk (not a threat to long term network security)

4) ISP censorship in a country like the US seems very far outside the realm of possibility, but never say never?

# OVERVIEW

Bitcoin has a reputation for being more complicated than it is. What I‚Äôm trying to do here is explain the bare minimum so you get the ideas without the technical jargon. Ideally, this is supposed to be golden retriever level simple - blame me if it isn't. We‚Äôll start with the underlying concepts, then necessary info on bitcoin, and lastly an analogy to put it all together.

# LEDGERS, MONEY, AND BANKS

Bitcoin is a blockchain, and a blockchain is a type of ledger. People invented ledgers hundreds of years ago to solve some problems with tangible money, or ‚Äúcash‚Äù. You would give some of your cash to a guy with a big ledger book and feather pen. He‚Äôd keep your money safe and write the total beside your name in the ledger, like an account balance. Effectively, this means you traded cash for ‚Äúnumbers-on-a-page‚Äù, but it made things more convenient and you trusted feather pen guy.

Feather pen guy‚Äôs job was to write down transactions between people while keeping track of everyone's account balance. Transactions were done by feather pen guy subtracting the cost from your balance, and adding the cost to the balance of whoever you wanted to pay. With your signature beside each transaction to verify it, no one could fake a transaction to pay themselves. You could even have ‚Äútransactions-by-mail‚Äù where you sent feather pen guy the details of the transaction you wanted to make - like a check. So, feather pen guy was like a middleman that held your money, processed transactions, and kept track of your account balance.

If everyone adopted this system, would we even need cash? We could do all our transactions in the ledger book. To start an account, instead of giving feather pen guy cash, we could have someone pay us through the ledger. Like receiving your first paycheck by direct deposit or check instead of cash. ‚ÄúLedger-money‚Äù is no different from ‚Äúcash-money‚Äù. They‚Äôre both the same money but in two different forms. This is why there are no ‚Äúcash bitcoins‚Äù - they're not needed. So, if there is no cash, ledger-money could *only* come from the previous transactions that transferred you money. In that case, all money would be a transaction record or ‚Äúnumbers-on-a-page.‚Äù

In modern times, feather pen guy and his ledger are what we‚Äôd call a bank. Consider your bank account; you deposit money and they hold it for you. When you buy something with your card it's subtracted from your account balance and added to the balance of whoever you paid. Instead of slow transactions-by-mail, we have instant transactions over the internet. So your bank is the middleman aka *feather pen guy* between you and whomever you pay (or pays you). The money in your bank account comes from previous transactions or the initial cash deposit you made in exchange for ‚Äúnumbers-on-a-screen.‚Äù Although we still use cash in society, it's not hard to see how we could replace all cash with bank accounts. This ‚Äúnumbers-on-a-screen‚Äù and absence of cash causes most of the confusion about where and what bitcoin is, but we have used these same concepts since ledgers were created.

# SOME INFO ON BITCOIN

Bitcoin is a ledger with some differences from the one we just covered. Instead of trusting feather pen guy (or a bank) to record transactions in his ledger, we all ‚Äúshare‚Äù the same ledger. This ledger uses the internet to automatically update each new transaction. Only the ledger that the **majority** of people use is considered legitimate and that you can make/receive a payment. This is what's called *decentralization* and means we don't have to trust a single person/company to maintain the ledger.

**How do you get bitcoins?**

You can get bitcoins just like any other currency, you just have to do one of the following: trade your dollars with someone that already has bitcoins, sell your goods or labor for bitcoins (like how you make money), or make new bitcoins (below).

**Where is Bitcoin?**

Bitcoin exists on a computer program called *Bitcoin Core*. Bitcoin Core is what manages everything that makes Bitcoin work. It isn't owned by any single person or company. Instead, it's managed by a large group of people.

**How are bitcoins made? (*****Mining)***

Bitcoins are created by solving a difficult math problem that can only be solved by computers. When a computer solves one of these problems, the answer is shared with other computers that check it. The answers to those problems are Bitcoins. The whole process is similar to a complicated version of ‚Äú2+?=4‚Äù. If Alice (the person that owns the solving computer) says the answer is 2, we (the checking computers) would all agree she's correct and she‚Äôd get some bitcoins from the Bitcoin software (not a person). This is all done automatically by computers on the software. This whole process is called *mining.* \*It's important to note that eventually no more bitcoins will be made. I‚Äôm intentionally leaving out a lot of confusing info here to avoid triggering anyone‚Äôs High School algebra PTSD so don't call me a liar.

**How are bitcoins used to pay someone?**

When Alice pays Bob with bitcoin, it updates the ledger with the transaction and transfers that answer to him. By looking at the transaction history, we can trace the bitcoins from Bob back to that initial math answer. So bitcoin is the answer to a math problem and a transfer record of sorts.

**Why are bitcoins valuable?**

Bitcoins are valuable only because people believe they are - like gold, beanie babies, or money. Money is just paper or numbers on a screen, it has no real-value like food or gas. Money is valuable *because* we can trade it for things with real-value. The belief that if we are given money today, we can trade it with someone tomorrow is what makes it valuable. Bitcoin is the same.

**Why use bitcoins?**

People use bitcoins because they don't want banks or the government to have any of their private information. Plus, if the government decides to print more money, it can cause inflation (since there are a limited number of bitcoins, inflation isn't a problem). By using some complex math, bitcoin is made anonymous like cash and secure like bank accounts. This complex math is called, ‚Äúhash function cryptography‚Äù and, ‚Äúelliptic curve digital signature algorithms‚Äù - but we won't be going over that.

# AN ANALOGY OF THE FIRST BITCOINS

Imagine a group message thread between people on a messaging app - let's call it ‚ÄúBitcoin Core.‚Äù The thread is like a page from the ledger book and has many transactions between people. When a new math problem is solved, the software automatically creates a new thread. The solver is awarded bitcoins in a special message on the new thread. Everyone moves to the new thread, the previous thread is locked and saved for records. Everyone has agreed to use the ledger that the majority of people use. So, if anyone tries to create their own thread, they're on their own. Lastly, by using similar math that creates bitcoins, we can link the previous threads to the current one. If someone tries to alter an old thread, it will have a ripple effect and create a thread that the majority of people *aren't* using. This is how we get the term *blockchain.* Threads have the following:

**The thread itself -** ***Blocks -*** like pages in the ledger book, organizes and secures transactions mathematically.

**Message senders &amp; receivers -** ***Transactors*** are the people in the message thread being paid or paying each other. The bitcoin software is a special transactor that only gives bitcoin to the solver.

**Messages -** ***Transactions*** are the transactions between people. With each group message thread, many transactions between people are recorded.

**Signatures -** ***Signatures*** are what verify a transaction as legitimate, just like signing a check. These aren't normally part of text messages, but it may help to think of email signatures or cringey text signatures from middle school.

[It might look something like this](https://imgur.com/a/I1n5n0C)

# SUMMARY

Bitcoins start as the answer to a math problem. These answers are transferred to people as a form of payment. A shared ledger keeps track of who solved the original math problem, and to who it has been transferred to since. Ultimately, bitcoins are only valuable because people believe they are.",~1000 words simply explaining how bitcoin works so you don't have to explain it to your mom,103

This my first attempt. I really tried to tone down the technicalities. I will convert this into a proper blog with more visual aspect but thought could post it here to get the feedback or any logical mistakes I did. 

Since it is a draft, please ignore the bad English. It is not my first language. I will gradually proof read. 

Also, if you like it and want to tip me. That would encourage me to write more from my understanding and earn sats: LNURL1DP68GURN8GHJ7AMPD3KX2AR0VEEKZAR0WD5XJTNRDAKJ7TNHV4KXCTTTDEHHWM30D3H82UNVWQHKSMMVD3HHWAM9V4JR2VGFGQJWT

Here we go:
Imagine a scenario where

Month 1: Alice has 5 dollars,  Bob has 7 dollars and Harry has 20 dollars to start with. And there is an apple in a room.
 Bob really wants an apple, than Alice and than Harry (in decreasing order of want)

In a normal bidding for the apple. There is good chance Bob can get an apple as he willing to pay major portion of his money for an apple. He ends up paying 6 dollars for this apple. 

Now there is a person who comes and hands over disproportionate amount of money to each one. Since Harry is the friend of the person that comes. He gets an extra 10 dollar and everyone else gets 1 dollar each. 

Month 2: After working hard for that month each one gets paid equally (to keep it simple), 5 dollars per month. 

Now Alice has 11 dollars, Bob has 7 dollars and Harry has 35 dollars. 

After few days, they need apple. And now Alice really needs an apple, after that harry and Bob has no appetite for apple anymore this month. 

In the bidding now, Harry can basically outbid Alice and acquire apple at 12 dollars (can be lower also). Still leaving him 23 dollars. 

The person comes again and hands over 20 dollars to Harry and 2 dollars to everyone else. 

Month 3: They earn another 5 dollars for their hard work. 

Now Alice has 18 dollars, Bob has 14 dollars and Harry has 48 dollars. 

In the next round Harry really needs that apple, after that Bob and Alice is least interested. Harry has to outbid everyone else with just bidding 14 dollars or less.

This can continue for many iterations and what we will see is that the person coming into room and disproportionately distributing money to his friend Harry (very low interest loans look below for reference) and some small amount to Alice and Bob (stimulus cheque for example) is making the cost of acquiring asset (apple) for Harry cheaper and cheaper (in percentage wise bases, which he can sell for more price later) but the price of that apple is going up (from 6 dollars to 12 dollars to 14 dollars in 3 iteration) for Alice and Bob, making it impossible for them to acquire any asset (apple). 

Hence, the saying, "" Rich becoming richer and poor becoming poorer"". Buying a house, artwork, yatch is a distant dream for many now. 

This is the present economy of the world. That we all live in.



Now let's see how BTC changes that:

In the same scenario, Alice has 5 BTC, Bob has 7 BTC and Harry has 20 BTC to start with. 

In the first iteration of the scenario described above Bob will pay 6 BTC to acquire that apple. 

The beauty is that in the world where everything is running on BTC. No person will enter the room and disproportionately give more BTC to Harry and small amounts to Bob and Alice. 

Month 2: In the second iteration of the above scenario, they earn 5 BTC each that month.

That leaves Alice with 11 BTC, Bob has 6 BTC and Harry has 25 BTC.

 Since in second iteration, Harry did not get any disproportionate amount of extra BTC from his friend. And also acquiring that apple will require him to out bid Alice which will be reduce his BTC holdings by 44%. It will become a question of how much Harry wants that apple. And as described above, it is Alice really wanting that apple this month. 

If Harry doesn't bid (given he doesn't want that apple this month)  the price of that apple still stays 6 BTC. 


Month 3: They each earn another 5 BTC leaving  Alice with 10 BTC , Bob with 11 BTC and Harry still has 30 BTC. 

As described in the above, now Harry really wants that apple now, but since there are no other bidders. He will get the apple at the price of 6 BTC. Reducing his BTC count to 24 BTC. 

Let's do another iteration to extend this scenario. 

Month 4: Each earn another 5 BTC with their hard work. 

Now Alice has 15 BTC, Bob has 16 BTC and Harry has 29 BTC. 

In this month it has been 3 months that Bob did not buy any apple and he really wants an apple now. Since he really wants the apple he can pay the previous price of 6 BTC that Harry paid. No one else wanted to get the apple because in this system acquiring BTC can only be done  with your hard work only. It is therefore reducing everyone frivolous spending and consumerism (root cause of many problems). 

Also it can be noted that, the overall wealth of three of them is becoming more less equal each month that passes by.

Another amazing thing that has happened which should not go unnoticed that price of apple has stabilized in this free maket at 6 BTC.

 In future the price can go up or down according how many people want that apple (Jim, the BTC miner coming with 100 BTC that he acquired with from mining BTC and out bidding next person to increase the price to 7 BTC), but in long run will stay predictable and people can plan for it.  

In this society, people have to do hard work (by selling their expertise or services or goods), create value for society to get that 5 BTC each month and these people can save that 5 BTC each month knowing that when they really want that apple in few months, with hard work they can afford that apple. The ultimate PROOF OF WORK. 

This is the power of BTC and the money that has fixed supply and limited resource. 

I hope this made sense if you read it till here. I am happy to receive feedback.

I highly recommend watching the [mempool blocks getting filled in real time](https://mempool.space/mempool-block/0). I can watch the little squares getting arranged for hours.

If you did any of the following this cycle you are contributing to the harm of others and I want you to SERIOUSLY consider changing your behavior.

1) Recommending people borrow to buy Bitcoin. Saylor is especially guilty of this among many other things.

2) Promoted TA or price evangelism. Every single person who was parroting plan B, willywoo, tone vays, or anyone else's nonsense and downvoting common sense caution is a part of the problem and harming their peers.

3) Enabled shitcoins or shitcoin exchanges. You are giving these bad actors money, you are enabling risk for yourself, and if you are recommending any of these exchanges or products to others you are causing harm. A shitcoin exchange is only as safe as their competency and their shittiest shitcoin will allow, and that makes NONE of these services safe.

4) Spreading technical misinformation. Andreas is especially guilty of this but I've seen it from wallet manufacturers, from every media personality, and even some devs who get lost in their passion. If you want to understand something in the bitcoin ecosystem, use and share primary sources! Social media is no place to learn.

With that said, lets make this community better in the future and collectively dissuade the behaviors I'm talking about, as well as the social media cults that lead to people committing these errors. I don't think moderators should be handling these specific problems, I think these are organic community problems well within the rules and we need to address them ourselves.

To those who have been all along through the bull market cautioning every new user about 80% dips and social media personalities while 99% of people laughed, THANK YOU. You are doing the work this community desperately needs. To everyone else, lets do better tomorrow!

I started to deal with Bitcoin c.a 2 years ago and since then I have bought BTC, in regular intervals. These are since day one on my Coinbase account. But now I would like to send my BTC to a cold wallet.

Which wallets do you recommend? I have often heard of BitBox, Ledger and Trezor ...

On the other hand I have heard that these are not open source and therefore not 100% safe, does anyone here have more information for me and can tell me about his experiences.

**#1 Clark Moody Bitcoin**

This dashboard remains in my opinion in the absolute top. All kinds of information and stats, including LN‚ö°Ô∏è, in a neat and simple way. I would call it ‚Çø pr0n.

[https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/)  


&gt;*Clark Moody Bitcoin is a growing collection of Bitcoin tools and information. The original version of this website goes back to 2011 with the launch of the first real-time market data site in the Bitcoin space. Back then, Mt. Gox was the only show in town, and Clark Moody Bitcoin brought interactive charts and a live order book to the crypto trader.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Shortly after Bitcoin reached $1.00 in February 2011, I learned about the project. At the time, I was interested in markets and trading, so I gravitated toward the free and open real-time market data coming from Mt. Gox. By the time I announced my first Bitcoin website* [*on the forum*](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=11560.msg163083#msg163083) *in early June 2011, Bitcoin had already climbed past $10.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Over the intervening years, my projects have always had something to do with the market data side of Bitcoin. It wasn‚Äôt until the launch of my* [*Dashboard*](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/) *that I presented network-level stats with the same real-time focus that I dedicated to market data projects.*

Personally at the moment I'm ~~mildly obsessed~~ interested in block time.

I was talking to my dad last night about money and I was explaining why I care so much about investing, unlike him - he is relatively old (late 60s) and I am relatively young (late 20s) - if I wanted to, I could invest in something that is bound to do well in the long run, like BTC, and then because of my resource of time and young age, I could make far more money than him; patience and reasonable investing, is the conversation of how you translate your youth into wealth. If he tried to do the same as me, he'd make less money because has less of the financial fuel of time, to convert into money. In fact, he's saved a lot of money in his life, but a huge amount of it has been lost through inflation. So that's another thing that's hit him, and I hope it doesn't hit me too hard.

If you're young, now is certainly the time to understand what you're (currently) sitting on: the string on your bow is far longer than it's ever going to be. You can put some wealth onto that bow, and you can spring that into the future unlike the older generation. Use that to your advantage, because eventually that's going to disappear before you even know it.","If you're still young, you own one of the most valuable resources on this planet",0

Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that locks the ""global currency"" class, and its function as a store of value has been recognized by the world and Wall Street.

There is no denying that Bitcoin is a consensus, but there are important underlying values behind the formation of a consensus: Bitcoin offers people another option, a fairer monetary policy. According to the output mechanism of the Bitcoin white paper, the following two Fixed rules:

‚ù∂ Bitcoin produces blocks approximately every 10 minutes, and every time a new block is created, a new bitcoin is minted.

‚ù∑The number of cryptocurrency rewards is adjusted every 210,000 blocks produced by Bitcoin. 21 million is the upper limit of the Bitcoin supply and no one, no government, can change it, which is what makes Bitcoin so powerful.

The second and more important underlying value is Censorship Resistance, which means that a technology has the ability to make the government ""unstoppable"". Censorship-resistant technology is not about replacing the established order and making everything unmanageable. It's about providing new options for people to co-exist with the established order.

Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt take away the state's control over legal tender; rather, more subtly, it makes legal tender less absolutely important.

From a technical point of view, it's based on the logic of the Internet and computer computing.

Blockchain technology is powerful in that for the first time it has successfully enabled the internet to 'deliver value'.

Including Gary Gensler of MIT Sloan School of Management (currently Chairman of the SEC), who believes that blockchain technology opens up entirely new possibilities for humanity.

Bitcoin can't only co-exist with other fiat currencies and be used on a daily basis, this initiative brings more freedom to people and government.

People are given an additional 'Plan B' option to avoid the collateral damage of vicious inflation caused by the wrong monetary policy of the local government. The Government of the Republic of El Salvador/Central African Republic is no longer completely subject to foreign monetary policies such as those of the US and international sanctions, and has gained more fiscal autonomy. It was only after the Russo-Ukrainian war that everyone realised how important a neutral currency was.

Bitcoin, as the most neutral currency in the world, will not reject any country or people, and there are no currency controls or foreign exchange sanctions. If more countries, governments and corporate organisations join in the future, El Salvador and Central Africa Republic, as early participants, will gain disproportionate advantages and benefits in the future, and may have the opportunity to tear down the black pages of the past and leapfrog into the Singapore and Israel of the Web 3.0 generation.",Is it a good thing or a bad thing for cryptocurrencies to become legal tender ?,3

**What are Bitcoin crits?**

Bitcoin Crits are opportunities for bitcoin products to get design critiques (crits) on a particular page in their product. Actionable suggestions for improving usability, user interface, interaction, and visual aesthetics are given by members in the Bitcoin Design Community.

**How does it work?**

1. A bitcoin product submits the page or section they want reviewed on Bitcoin Crits in the [\#design-review](https://bitcoindesign.slack.com/archives/C019MTNFKL7) channel in the Bitcoin Design Slack.

We will only focus on a particular page or small section of your product so we can give the highest amount of value. Reviewing a whole product is an extensive and involved process that is better suited to be dealt with by a dedicated Product Designer. If you need a Product Designer for your bitcoin product, reach out in the [\#opportunities](https://bitcoindesign.slack.com/archives/C016D659EU9) channel in Bitcoin Design Slack.

2. A product is selected for the next upcoming Bitcoin Crit call by members of the community. If demand is high, we may have to include your product in a backlog.

3. Product designers interested in reviewing jump into a collaborative Figma file where they crit the product page submitted **PRIOR** to the Bitcoin Crit call. This will all be public and open for anyone to view in classic open-source fashion.

4. Product designers who crit the product present their feedback to the product team in the scheduled Bitcoin Crit call.

Follow up help and suggestions on the feedback given is always available.

**Who can take part?**

Anyone who is working on a bitcoin product. Whether its a new page you want reviewed before release, or an old page that needs polishing, Bitcoin Crits can help. Open-source products get priority over closed-source products.

Calls are recorded and open for anyone to join in and view the crit take place. We greatly appreciate the pseudonymous and private nature of bitcoin and are more than happy to accommodate those who would prefer not to reveal their identity.

**When do these happen?**

Once a week on Wednesdays 2:00PM UTC time starting next week. Bitcoin Crits happen in our public Jitsi channel [here](http://meet.jit.si/BitcoinCrit). Calls are recorded and open for anyone to join in and view the crit take place. If you do not wish for the call to be recorded we can accommodate.",Bitcoin Product Design reviews,1

Given how people that are into the coin thing constantly keep saying how good the crypto coin is and how fiat currency is bad, ect.  And that you should invest in the coin. So if the coin is the important thing, why do you care what the exchange rate of your coin into USD or EUR is?

Does the exchange rate into this dirty fiat currency change the amount of coins you have?  If not, than why do you care what the exchange rate is? Even if the exchange rate is 100Bitcoins = 0.01¬¢ , you still have the 100 coins. And its the coins you wanted, and bought, no??",Coin Valuations,0

My concern is someone like Musk and Bezos might come up with some ""moral"" justification to change the governance model of bitcoin. By moral, I of course mean something greedy, but disguised as a positive to ""radically improve lives"" of the working class. If they do, they can then can buy/hire half the miners for a day to ""fix the fundamentals"" of bitcoin with a 51% attack. Greed and incentives will blind the miners, who are often shady AF. I fear this might happen after bitcoin reaches 15-20 trillion in total value. Because by then, all employers will be paying in bitcoin, and thus employees will not have any option to opt out of accepting bitcoin ever. If its a reasonable fear, we might end up with a crypto government... with the potential to tax us without needing our votes to stay in power. If its not a reasonable fear, I'd be glad if you could let me know why.

Edit: Thanks for responses. The answer given in the response indicate that 51% attacks cannot alter the governance, but can only be temporarily damaging. A sustained change would require a fork.

Fortunately, a millionaire full of money arrives and enters the only small hotel on town and asks for a room. He puts a $100 bill on the receptionist's desk and goes to see the room.

- The hotel manager grabs the note and rushes off to pay his debts with the butcher.

- The butcher grabs the note and rushes off to pay his debt with the pig farmer.

- The pig farmer rushes out to pay his debt to the miller who provides food for the animals.

- The miller takes the note and goes running to settle his debt with the street prostitute (in times of crisis, in that small town where everybody knows each other, she offers services on credit...

- The prostitute goes to the small hotel, where she had brought her clients the last few times and still hadn't paid. She hands over the note to the owner of the hotel.

At this moment the millionaire comes down, who has just seen the rooms, says that he is not convinced by any of them, and takes the note back.

But a lot of new entrants get worried over investing and even panic sell to ""save"" their losses. 

Thankfully with some right knowledge, it is quite possible to convince them not to give in to the price fall and actually use this opportunity to buy. Sharing some pointers here:

**Historical data:** 

One of the best ways to assess bitcoin's performance is to look at its historical data.  Looking at the logarithmic regression of the bitcoin price *\[also known as the rainbow chart\]*, which takes the historical data of bitcoin price and charts the future trajectory of its price movement, shows a clear **upward trend** in the coming years. 

https://preview.redd.it/jizi9ipysr691.png?width=1263&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7d9fcd8c0abd5b1b042074bd9f88c8732ca46e8

**Adoption:**

Another great indicator of any asset's success is its adoption by the mainstream audience.  Bitcoin is seeing an exponential adoption within the mainstream with the **number of active addresses** seeing a clear upward trend in the past years. 

The same trend is seen for the **number of transactions per day** recorded on the bitcoin blockchain. 

**Volatility:**

Bitcoin's current price of $20,500 is almost a 70% price decrease from its all-time high of $69,000 back in November 2021.

But these price drops are also a great opportunity for new investors to enter the market and buy some bitcoin.

**Technology:**

There is no argument that bitcoin technology is truly revolutionary and is set to disrupt multiple industries, the biggest one of course being financial. 

In a matter of 10 years, blockchain has become a multi-billion dollar industry and is only expected to grow as its ecosystem expands.

The masses are being systematically shaken down by the classes when it comes to BTC. When the dust settles, 90%+ of all coins will exist in less than 2% of all wallets or something similar to the last bear market. 

I believe we are going lower for one reason. Too many people are at break even at current prices. 

There are not enough losers yet. Too many bought around $20k. 

If you recall, the Coinbase CEO published data showing that record numbers of people were using their $1,200 stimulus checks to buy BTC. This was right around the time BTC was in the $20k range. 

These people have to be flushed out. 

There‚Äôs never been a time in human history where a large group of people got together and became rich. 

There never will be. 

The Classes control markets. The Classes executed a marketing campaign to make folks believe millions of us have Lambos, together. The masses ate it up. 

Now the Classes will have to inflict terror and pain to get hold outs to sell low, after buying high. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see any price at this point.

post,vgha86,2s3qj,bitcoin,false,1655716546,https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/vgha86/sold_my_btc_for_120/,self.bitcoin,,"First post here, but I want to address some of the sentiment I've seen with this crash...

Backstory: When I first bought BTC, I saw it as a risky investment and was excited to get a 50% ROI. When it quickly jumped from $80 to $120, I sold all 40, and it was the easiest $1,600 I ever made. I do not regret that I could have pulled millions at ATH, because 50% is a great return on a short, volatile, risky investment. I later bought back at \~$10k, $20k, and $30k, because I learned over time and came to believe in the underlying technology and the ability for cryptocurrency to change the way money works. 

Since then, I have watched every rise and fall, every meme of the vertical roller coaster in both directions. I don't DCA (although that's wise), just hold. I saw the price hit $70,000, now I am curious if we will see sub $10k or even $1k. But, if it goes to zero, I lost it because I believe in a concept that may not work out - no regrets.

So, recent entrants to this game, some advice from an old-timer who understands opportunity cost:

**Crypto is not a get rich quick scheme.** When your dumbest friends on IG get hacked because they believe $500 can become $10,000 overnight from mining is when you should consider how dumb some of this speculative money is. The faster it's out, the better. 

**If you** ***are*** **going to gamble, pick an exit point before you enter.** And when it hits, cash out. You are playing in a casino. Much like a loan to a friend, it's a gift until it's returned.

**Not your keys, not your coins**. Things are bad right now... and who knows, maybe Coinbase is next to fall. Do you want to find out the hard way if you can recover your investment?

**Money isn't everything.** There are some very happy people without a pot to piss in, and some miserable people who have nothing but money. Of course, we're here for a reason - money is important, but it is not the only thing that matters. If you mistreat your family and friends over a red number, you're an asshole, plain and simple.

**Technical analysis is guesswork.** Sometimes it's right, usually it isn't. If anyone knew the future, they'd be too wealthy to use a YouTube channel or blog.

Above all else, **do not gamble more than you can lose.** If you lose every penny, can you pay your rent? Can you still do the things that make you happy? Will your family be okay? If you have to wonder about the answers, you are risking too much.

Good luck everyone. Whether we see $0 or $100,000 next, I'll be here with you.",Sold my BTC for $120...,124

post,vgf8sy,2s3qj,bitcoin,false,1655708168,https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/vgf8sy/i_am_66_slave/,self.bitcoin,,"I recently read Knut Svanholm‚Äôs ‚ÄúBitcoin: Everything Divided by 21 Million‚Äù and within the book there is a section that discusses all of the various ways we are taxed on our time.

There are direct taxes that impact me and my earning potential such as income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes, state¬†and local taxes. There are also indirect taxes that affect me in ways that are a bit more difficult to quantify like inflation (an invisible tax that diminishes the purchasing power for the dollars I keep) and corporate taxes (revenue that could have all or in part gone into employee salaries).

Months prior I listened to a podcast with Robert Breedlove where he discussed the idea that one‚Äôs effective tax rate is a representation of how much a slave one is to the state. A statement I felt was bold, but the argument was interesting: what is slavery if not a 100% tax on your time and energy?

I decided to take the challenge and determine how much a ""slave"" I really am. I reviewed my paycheck, my property tax bill, my monthly purchases and my state tax rate. The result ~~surprised me to say the least~~ **sounds about right**.

Here are the numbers represented **as a percentage of my gross income**:

* Federal Income Tax: ~~26.16%~~ **17.36%**
* State Income Tax: ~~10.66%~~ **7.08%**
* Medicare Tax: ~~2.16%~~ **1.44%**
* Disability Tax: ~~1.64%~~ **1.09%**
* Social Security Tax: ~~9.25%~~ **6.14%**
* Property Tax: ~~4.94%~~ **3.28%**
* Monthly Expense Sales Tax (@ 7.75% rate): ~~2.71%~~ **0.15%**
* **Total Tax:** ~~57.52%~~ **36.53%**

And that‚Äôs just explicit taxes. The latest Consumer Price Inflation print for June 2022 was 8.6%. Simply adding the CPI figure into the sum puts me at a ~~66.12%~~ **45.13%** total tax rate.

For every 3 hours of work, the value created by 2 is taken from me and given to the government.

I am ~~66%~~ **45%** ~~slave~~ **serf**. How about you?

EDIT:

There were essentially 4 types of comments:

1. ""You're a moron and did your math wrong."" These people were right. Totally did my math wrong and have updated the values.
2. ""You're a moron to compare your lifestyle to slavery."" I don't know if they are right, but slavery does have a harsh association with it so I'll go with ""serf"" instead.
3. ""You're a moron and bitcoin doesn't fix this."" My post didn't say that it does, but it does. Bitcoin cannot be confiscated and cannot be inflated to more than 21,000,000. By these features alone, the total tax rate on the individual would be lessened.
4. ""Roads."" Yes, I use roads. However, I think the collective population would be a better, more efficient capital allocator than most government.",I Am 66% Slave,387

However, one of these functions is more important than others: STORE OF VALUE

Money MUST be scarce. Its the one key thing about money: everything else is frosting to the cake (unit of account, medium of exchange etc etc). Scarcity allows money to retain, and even increase, its value over time

Your work, labor, sacrifice is not infinite. Thus money must represent this, or you are getting robbed: allow me to elaborate more: 

Modern econ and finance made us forget the importance of scarcity in money. These two disciplines nowadays exist to prove the Earth (USD) is the centre of the universe. That storing value is passe and unimportant. Consumption beyond ones means is good, thus inflation is good, and saving money is a sin.

Fiat does medium of exchange well, if you are lucky enough to be banked (as a unit of account fiat is being compromised by inflation, and always has been by shadow inflation, but thats a different story) 

Fiat would do ok as money, if not for that pesky key function: hold its value. This point is non debatable, and why the USD is constitutionally supposed to be backed by a set amount of precious metals https://deanclancy.com/the-constitutions-seven-money-clauses/

The founding fathers were not stupid. They studied history, especially Roman history, and saw that sound money was the foundation of democracy.

Without store of value, what you get at best is currency. Cigarettes were used as currency, sea shells, pokemon cards etc
Are you obtuse enough to need explanation why cigarettes are a bad form of money, though they can function ok as currency?

If the USD/fiat regime really isnt money, why isnt the price of gold much higher? Gold is far more scarce than fiat, right?

This is where things get diabolical: to obfuscate the truth of the depreciation of fiat, governments worldwide colluded to manipulate gold, through the creation of Futures markets, while also confiscating gold from their citizens and then selling it at strategic moments.

Gold is supposed to be the Sun, before bitcoin came around: a measure of the true value (or lack thereof) of fiat. So what governments did is they created paper gold, through the futures market, to inflate away the value of gold. Banks were happy to execute these trades, to front run them and make easy profits.

Imagine you knew gold was about to get dumped big time: you would open your own short position before executing the government‚Äôs sell order. 

There is a literal website with proof of this, it is NOT conspiracy theory: https://www.gata.org

Commodity manipulation is an institution of modern finance.

Gold fails because its not feasible to audit the reserves of gold a government has. Thus futures market can be used to naked short sell gold (sell gold without actually owning it), create paper contracts claiming gold ownership, without actually having to own physical gold.

Why cant we have audits? Gov can just temporarily buy enough for the audit, have some real gold and the rest be shiny crap metal etc etc. Bitcoin, through the open blockchain on the other hand, can have its supply verified at any moment by anyone.

The consequence is that without a measure tool, it seems as if currencies are stable BUT ONLY RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER. All fiat currencies are going down together:


https://cdn.knoema.com/infographics/Knoema_Data_Driven_Gold_and_Fiat_Money.png 

Notice how even with gold manipulation, currencies are tanking relative to gold. But if you only follow fiat currency conversion rates(USD/EUR, CAD/USD etc), fiat seem to be doing ok: last decade USD was stronger, next one probably the renmbi/yuan, Euro was strong at its inception, now its weakening etc.

For the sake of brevity, I won‚Äôt even start to describe the games central banks play to manipulate their currency vs others.

The important thing is to understand fiat is currency, gold/silver should be money but governments figured out how to dull that threat, and bitcoin fixes this by design.

Similar to gold, you can manipulate for a time the fiat value of bitcoin, but that pesky open blockchain allows any peasant to verify supply, and thus its scarcity.

Its time we understood the difference between money and currency, for own sake as sovereign individuals.

TLDR: money must be scarce, fiat is not. You dont own any money, only currency, unless you own physical gold/silver or better, bitcoin. Fiat is unconstitutional, gold is manipulated to hide the fall of fiat, fiat seems to be doing fine only relative to other fiat. Buy bitcoin to hold money that cant be manipulated, fiat value of bitcoin can be of course, but its not bitcoin itself being manipulated

I'm not rich - nor am I in the top 10 percent of income earners. I had some cash mostly left behind by my wonderful grandparents and my own money as well. Got greedy when I was up 20k in March and bought more. Learned a valuable lesson.

When you watch your portfolio drop past 50 percent it has an affect on you. I'm at the stage where I've accepted that this was meant to happen as a learning experience but it also solidified my determination for long term savings. 

Ultimately it's a good thing because I would have spent the money on bullshit had I sold my gains before the crash. I'm now taking a 10 year view on this technology. I hope to god that I'll not need any of it in the near to mid future - that's the only thing I worry about on occasion but at the same time I've always worried about retirement and having nothing in the bank when I'm too old.

I won't post the link here due to brigading rules, but you can find it over in r/CryptoCurrency

Well, with prices this low, I'm back at it again. I told myself if Bitcoin ever dropped down to $20k I would take out a loan to buy more. So I did...

I just got approved for a $20k loan with a 4.5% APR which I will be using to buy more Bitcoin at these discounted prices.

Why now?

The thing is, J. Pow keeps raising rates. The higher he raises rates, the more expensive it is to borrow money. So I'm doing this now to lock in a lower interest rate. This time around, I plan to DCA it into BTC much slower. If the macro situation is really as bad as they say, then BTC may still go lower.

The crazy thing is that I managed to get a lower interest rate this time! Back in February, the loan I got was 6% APR, but with the new $20k loan I'm only paying $4.5%! I have no idea why that is. The only thing that changed is that my credit score increased about 50 points, but I don't think that really explains it.

With the $15k loan I started DCAing it into BTC daily around February 23rd, 2022, a day or two before Russia invaded Ukraine. Within 8 weeks I had invest the full $15k at a cost basis of \~$38k. In retrospect, I should have spread it out longer, like 16 weeks instead of just 8. I won't make that mistake this time. I plan to DCA this current loan in BTC at $125 per day over the next 5 months or so... unless we drop to $13k, then I'll lump sum whatever is left.

I basically view this as a reverse DCA. Together, the combined loans require about $550 a month to service. I can afford this. Not a big deal.  I usually invest about $500-700 a month anyway, so it's still affordable for me. In fact, I'll most likely pay both of them off early just so that I save on the interest, not that it's much anyway.

My plan is simple: acquire and hold Bitcoin. I have no intention of selling, but if I did, I'd wait until at least 2032  because by then there will have been 3 halvings and 99% of Bitcoin will have been mined. So I think the price by then will be well over $100k if not $250k. But I'd rather just never sell at all.

Anyway, I will update in 6 months.","Just took out another loan ($20K) to buy Bitcoin... Also, update on the previous loan ($15K) from February.",0

Many people say that when we reach capitulation, there will be NO bulls at all left. All that will be left to see according to their description are people whining about losing their homes, the suicide hotline and a bunch of nerds left that talk about coding stuff. However this is not the case. 

I remember some dude posted the top posts from the day of the bottom of the 2018 bear market. Unfortunately, i could not find the post to pin it. However, scrolling through the comments of these top posts you would find many people that are still bullish.

Some other people were waiting for bitcoin to drop further until they could buy again and others completely lost hope it seemed and predicted that BTC would never hit its ATH of 20k again. Overall it did not differ much from the current subreddit. Maybe someone can pin a link to the archive, so that you can see for yourself. I think many people will be surpirsed to realize that the sentiment during a capitulation is not as bearish as one would think. 

I am not saying that the bottom is in. We are definitely in uncharted territory right now concerning the current global macro-economic sphere. But on the other hand it always seems to be that we are in uncharted territory. Just a few months back, we were in uncharted territory due to the amount of institutional investors in crypto. ""We will not have 90% corrections anymore. Crypto has matured. There are too many big players involved for it to happen."" And yet even though we continiously enter uncharted territory we always seem to fall back into the same 4- year-cycle. 

The 4-year-cycle has not been broken yet. Nearly all its major texhnical indicators signal  that we are in bottom territory. 

MVRV is in the green pocket
NUPL is in capitulation
Rainbow chart is at FIRE SALE
we have the highest deviation to the downside for the stock-to-flow chart in history.

For these things to matter one must believe in technical analysis. However, even without it, one cannot deny that fear is most defintely in the air right now. And buying in fear is generally better than buying during mania.

If someone believes in crypto fundamentally; that crypto- technology will be used in a big way, the markets right now seem to be objectively a reasonable time to enter the markets.

Since, mining rigs have been shutting down as a result of the price dropping, that means that the current pool of miners has shrunk, and the total hash rate is in the hands of a smaller group of people? Is this correct?

And another thing-- is it possible that Bitcoin just outright loses all of its miners entirely if the price gets too low to a point where it's economically unprofitable? Like.. how was it done when Bitcoin first started and the price was dirt cheap-- what was the economic incentive there? Is there a bit of game theory here that I may be missing? (i.e. If enough miners drop out, then it's economically sound to come back in? Even if the price crashes?)

I had several thousand in Bitcoin + random shitcoins (about 10x what I currently hold in fiat, because I‚Äôm an idiot) on Celsius as recently as a month ago. I decided to move 100% of my shitcoins into BTC because I never really believed in any of them anyway and I assumed they would universally do much worse than Bitcoin. I haven‚Äôt even checked to see if I was right. 

I also did the math and figured out that a few hundred bucks a year doesn‚Äôt really negate the risk of leaving my coins on Celsius. I never would have even worried about it if I didn‚Äôt constantly see posts on here trashing DeFi and shitcoins. Once the bill market had arrived, I began wondering if they were right. I had no idea how incredibly shady Celsius is/was at the time and I certainly had no idea they‚Äôd become basically insolvent. I‚Äôm a typical retarded gambler and I got lucky.

I should have never dabbled in shitcoins or DeFi and I certainly shouldn‚Äôt have used them as essentially my singular savings account. I fucked up, and I almost paid dearly. I‚Äôm still way down atm, but at least I have my coins in the only crypto worth holding in cold storage and I truly thank this sub for the constant warnings and am eternally grateful I finally listened to you guys in the nick of time.","I broke rule #1, and you guys saved me from ruin.",86

Bitcoin isn't gold and will never be. Bitcoin's advantage is that it's a far superior form of money. That's it! Why don't we focus on that? If the Bitcoin community had hired hordes of people, like Jehovah witnesses, to walk into retail businesses in all major cities, and offer to set them up to accept BTC as a form of payment for FREE, today we'd have a substantial amount of businesses across the world accepting BTC as a form of payment. This way people would  stop focusing on price fluctuations and instead would want to acquire Bitcoin because it's an increasingly popular decentralized and incorruptible **form of payment**.

I was lucky to have done a project to create replica BTC protocol in my master to understand the concepts. So had the bit of technical understanding of the concepts. 

But as an every new entrant in this ""Crypto"" space, I was bombarded with shitcoin projects that makes you believe that you can be rich in few days. Hence, making my time preference very high. Lost lot of money and altogether it was a shit show. 

But I gradually started asking myself that ""why did I enter this space at the first place?"" and also started reading the philosophical aspect of why BTC existed. 

Since then, I have gradual transition to being a BTC maxi because it did exactly what I wanted to do from the starting. ""Storing the value that I created with my skills"". 

I built a BTC node and started observing Mempool space and that has made me understand that this thing just works. It doesn't have any issues from outside world. It self adjust when outside parameters change. It almost feels like a self regulating body which will keep on doing what it is supposed to do. 

Self inflicted pain that I see with so many people in this space is because either they are too stuck on the price in short time or playing the leverage (get rich quick scheme).

Our society in present form is fast fast, fast this fast that- fast food, fast fashion, fast dating bullshit. This has reduced our concentration levels to records lows, inturn making our time preference to extremely high levels. 

The rich fucks that we all see are not made in one day, they are all old fucks now and are very rich now and will remain rich because they invested in their skills. 

LOWER YOUR TIME PREFERENCE. A person invested into this project for last 5 years or more is not crying over this price drop or increase . They are happy and away from this price prediction fuck allery that go around in this space. 

BTC is still the same protocol when it was 69k and when it is 19k. Rather became better with all the hashrate and all the BTC nodes that are making sure that the things written more than a decade before are still followed the same way.",Most of the pain that people feel in BTC space is self inflicted.,19

I have spent over 1000 hours the last few years to educate myself about bitcoin and lately I started thinking about where bitcoin could lead humanity in the long term.

The base would be Decentralization in almost every way thinkable.

1. Politics: 

Bitcoin could incentivize a decentralized world government and get rid of nations and borders all together. A world ruled by its inhabitants and not just a few privileged people. I personally think this would lead to smaller communities overall.

2. A new System of economy:

Forget about socialism capitalism or liberalism. This new decentralized system would support people and companies working closely together all over the globe. Following the concept of ‚ÄûOpen-Source‚Äú there would be huge communities in every Industrie communicating and sharing informations. In the long term everybody profits from sharing their own secrets. This could look like bitcoin mining, everybody contributes and in return gets rewarded for the contribution.

In that world CEOs would be voted by the people, no more idiots at the top of a company.

3. Bitcoin as a world currency

Over the long term worlds wealth would be distributed over the globe and you would have the same standard of living and the same prices for goods everywhere. 

Those are just some thoughts, I haven‚Äôt fully played them through, what do you guys/girls think?",Bitcoin Endgame Thoughts,1

This definitely has to do with how bitcoin is marketed with those who sold their assets (like the owner of Binance) took the risk and got rich. 

Guys time and life keeps on going when you are watching pretty much meaningless graphs. 

Freak capitalism yeah but it is okay to be content with what you have sometimes and actually spend it to enjoy it rather than tipping it to whales.

You still see the usual, ‚Äúoh no the energy usage and environment!‚Äù bullshit and yet with all the intelligent people in the world no one is pointing out that the entire world (partially thanks to the Russian war) is now fully on board with moving to electric cars by 2030 when recharging stations will be needed every 50 miles all over the globe at an absolute minimum. Countries will finally be forced to bring nuclear plants online and fully switch over to renewable energy sources.

And yet, Bitcoin and crypto was the problem despite the fact that regular users and buyers of crypto aren‚Äôt contributing to the problem if they buy and hold. It‚Äôs only the miners people have issues with, who it would be theoretically possible to push them towards states and countries which are already on board with fully renewable energy. But it‚Äôs obviously a non issue anyway since mining worldwide uses about the same amount of energy as gaming computers but no one‚Äôs worried about that.

Instead, you have mass amounts of people dogpiling onto Bitcoin for just the dumbest reasons and mass amounts of support for meme stocks (myself included if I‚Äôm being honest) when their ultimate goal is ‚Ä¶ NFTs? Digital wallets? People going back to movie theaters? Buying stuff online? I mean all that sounds great (except maybe NFTs as a business model) but when you sit down and think about it, it‚Äôs hardly something that can lead to a trillion dollar business. It‚Äôs very obviously just cheerleading something to punish hedge funds who got caught playing their usual games and now are on the hook if they can‚Äôt cover their shorts. That‚Äôs great - but it won‚Äôt be great when everyone dumps on each other if the price does eventually skyrocket because no one actually believes in these companies.

Meanwhile Bitcoin offers probably the biggest and most important goal of all: decouple from the banks. But people yawn at that. Even during a global recession which could eventually turn into stagflation, instead of seeing Bitcoin dipping as an opportunity, people see it as a reason to point and laugh.

What happened to cause the inflation? The government gave out pennies in various stimulus packages to regular people, and trillions to corporations. Politicians want you to ignore the trillions which are undoubtedly to blame for money being worth less, and curse yourself for accepting their pennies.

What‚Äôs happening now with crypto? With the cover of the recession, Russian war, supply line issues which should be resolved within a year, the biggest players are dumping and manipulating crypto.

Why are they dumping crypto? Because they‚Äôre gaining billions in liquidating longs and exchanges. The amazing thing you‚Äôre seeing is that people are cheering them on because they‚Äôre jealous and ignorant that they‚Äôre cheering on literal hedge funds and banks. Next week or month they‚Äôll turn it around and liquidate all of the shorts that accumulate due to bearish sentiment and then make billions more. They‚Äôll keep doing stuff like this because they can. They‚Äôll only stop when the entire worlds economy is on verge of collapse because that‚Äôs bad for business. Ruining peoples lives is no biggie though.

And yet, even if the masses spent the maybe 10 minutes to read my post and realize I‚Äôm right, people still won‚Äôt stop being dumb and panicky. They‚Äôll admit that yes, the price of Bitcoin is way down for no discernible reason. Yes, there is no reason to hate Bitcoin or crypto longterm (except for the idiots that fall for and are behind rug pulls). Yes, Bitcoin has way more noble and meaningful goals than any other project out there. 

There aren‚Äôt enough Bitcoin for everyone living on earth. GME and AMC can split their stocks and the CEOs can give it away to employees. If Bitcoin had the same level of support, not only would it ‚Äúlock the float‚Äù in a very real sense, but it would affect the entire worlds economy if there was an actual safe haven from inflation/deflation.

And then they‚Äôll finish by saying, ‚ÄúBut with all that, I see red in the price right now and I don‚Äôt like that. Crypto must be dying and even though it‚Äôs obvious it will skyrocket back up at some point, I‚Äôm not going to buy because I am a human who is subject to fight or flight, and I choose to panic.‚Äù

Bitcoin is accepted as the official currency by all the countries of the world.  The government in the country you live in is running out of your country's money as a result of wrong decisions or corruption.  It is no longer possible to create inflation by printing new money.  Therefore, the state has to give its citizens the next month's salary with deductions.  Your salary has decreased.  And see it instantly.  What will your reaction be?  You quickly realize that the government is not managing the economy well.  It cannot secretly impoverish you with inflation.  For example, if you lived in Turkey in 2022, the inflation declared by the government is around 75 percent.  Private companies say it is 150 percent.  And you'd see that most of the people still don't understand that the economy sucks.  But fortunately you live in 2040.  Because you only need to know how to count to understand that your money is underpaid the next month.
 Cryptocurrencies will enable bad administrations to be noticed quickly in countries.  This may shorten the life of governments, but it will prevent states from sinking completely.  This will be for the benefit of all humanity.  All people should have the economic power and wealth to meet their own needs.

I‚Äôd like to explain something to those that haven‚Äôt thought this through. Around 90% of bitcoin supply is already mined today. The next halving is far less relevant than those that came before, and that will continue in perpetuity.

Demand for the bitcoin in circulation is now the key driver to price action. The last 10% will be mined over the next 118 years. Do the math. That‚Äôs a tiny percentage of newly mined coins influencing total supply. The only reason halvings will spark price action to the upside is media driven hype. Not saying that hype won‚Äôt happen, but it‚Äôs not guaranteed as many imply.

The future of the price action you hope for in fiat gains as ‚Äúsupposed disciples of the new fair world economy run on bitcoin,‚Äù must be generated by market demand for the current supply because the added supply moving forward is negligible. 

It never ceases to amaze me how many newbs have just gulped the koolaid down, spewing rhetoric about hyperbitcoinization while they secretly just want to feel rich in fiat on paper. ‚ÄúHodl until next halving, it‚Äôs guaranteed to go up.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is the way.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for the tech.‚Äù ‚ÄúBitcoin will change the world, I can‚Äôt wait to buy my lambo in USD.‚Äù ‚ÄúBitcoin is the new gold.‚Äù

Time to depend on true utility to create market demand. Bitcoin still has a lot to prove. It won‚Äôt die, but speculative valuations in fiat in the future are anyones guess. Without utility the price action depends solely on finding more people to buy into the psychological belief that the value in its rarity is enough.

I know we are going through a big crash but don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll recover from that. Today I want to show you my new project. After 8 months of development it‚Äôs finally finished. The past years I‚Äôve learning programming and I wanted to apply some of the stuff that I learnt to Bitcoin. So, I created Maki.

Maki is a product that I've created for developers, researchers and hobbyist that want to access bitcoin blockchain data without provisioning a full node.

We all know that running a full node is expensive in term of resources or money and not viable for small apps or personal use, so Maki will take care of all the technical stuff and provide you with a set of endpoints to access transaction, block, and mempool data in an easy and simple way.

I‚Äôve created a few free API keys for you to test the endpoints:

15bc8b3e1e5f52641f5b92d7c3d088a4800519c3

If you need a free API key to test more or even a discount, just DM. This is my first product and my first humble contribution to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It will be great if you could give me some feedback.

Well, that‚Äôs it. Thanks for reading.

Here's my thinking on the situation Bitcoin finds itself. I did it last night while half awake :). 

Miners ought stop selling the bitcoin they mine, simply because the price is so low and eventually they'll be selling at zero! It's better for miners who haven't sufficient fiat, to buy electricity, to borrow it. After all, as fiat's value is being inflated away so too are any debts in fiat. Maybe better still for those miners who haven't enough fiat to buy electricity to simply stop mining, that'll reduce the hash rate and so the cost to the miners that do keep mining\[1\].

Anyway, that's as far as I got before I fell asleep. Zzzz...

We bitcoiners and many other types of investors have a hard time squaring this awful fact with others like how the USD is currently inflating over something like 20% and the petrodollar just died, so it's sure to lose its' world reserve currency status.

The fact is, both of these things are true. The dollar is inflating worse than it has at any point since the 1970's and at the same time the USD is super safe and strong in this environment... Because ALL OTHER CURRENCIES ARE EVEN WORSE.

It's just that simple. There are no more gold-backed currencies. Some countries, like Japan, are printing &amp; inflating far faster than we are. The rest are just suffering many of the same effects as the USD is. 

If you're in dollars now, good on you, be ready to buy bitcoin soon once we hit the bottom though. It could happen tonight or sometime next year. When it does and BTC decouples from traditional markets, things are going to change in a massive way. 

Will that tank the dollar and make it hyperinflate? Only after all other fiat currencies do so first. It'll happen all together though in one giant global depression, and it could start very soon. Many are going to be in a major world of hurt, many will even die, but it's unavoidable at this point and so you had better not be holding anything other than bitcoin, and possibly still the dollar, when that starts happening.

This essentially means the only thing backing the dollar is the government.

How do you prove you‚Äôre a strong government? War.

 Throughout history governments  used money  to fuel war. War is a dividend that comes with compounding rewards. Land, slaves, commodities etc. 

Theirs a reason the United States  is the world police, it proves the dollars worth. 

It‚Äôs impossible for this to be sustainable, not even factoring in inflation.

Even without inflation we essentially need to show force of our government, or have the largest military in the world at all times. 

So we do both, we intervene in everything and spend more money on  the military  than every country on earth.

From there governments started to reduce the precious medal content of coins and eventually created fiat currency since people couldn‚Äôt scalp  the gold from them,Fiat currency was perfect because they can maintain the centralized power of the currency while providing us with paper.


This allowed bankers to print endless amounts of money  backed by nothing but the government. 

Bitcoin solves every problem currency‚Äôs have But at the same time  takes all the power from the government and gives it to us.

If you're solely focusing on crypto, then you're most likely missing the forest for the trees. It's not just crypto that's tanking. Let me repeat: **it's not just crypto that's tanking**. Everything is tanking. And I do mean **everything**.

* Stocks are now officially in a [bear market](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/bear-market) with no bottom in sight as it falls below the 20% [threshold](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.INX:INDEXSP?window=YTD).
* High yield investment grade bonds are [collapsing](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/HYG:NYSEARCA?window=YTD), also with no end in sight. (Yes, 15% is a collapse in bond terms).
* Even safe assets like 7-10 year treasuries are [sinking](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/IEF:NASDAQ?window=YTD) as well. My bond bros can back me up. A 12% drop in a **fixed** income ETF? That's really, really bad.
* National currencies like the [Yen](https://www.ifcmarkets.com/en/market-data/personal-instrument-pci-prices/jpy-index) aren't safe either.
* Real estate and gold are the last legs to fall. Why are they last? Liquidity. Gold doesn't move very often and real estate tends to lag other assets due to its lengthier acquisition process. But we're already seeing signs that [real estate](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/VNQ:NYSEARCA?window=YTD) is going to tank.

The **only** safe place to be is cold hard [United States Dollar](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy). **Cash** is going to be **king** for the foreseeable future and I don't anticipate that changing anytime soon. So if you're living outside America, I feel sorry for you, I really do. I have no advice other than try to get more $USD. For those in the States, here's what you should be doing going forward:

* **Don't** over leverage. That means don't borrow money, don't mortgage your house, and don't max out your credit cards if you can help it.
* **Do** cut spending and save as much cash as possible.
* **Don't** buy the dip. It's not a dip, it's a falling knife.
* **Do** re-evaluation your allocation. I've put 10% of my net worth into crypto and it's now sitting at 5%. I don't plan on re-allocating back to 10% because I was clearly over-exposed. I'm going to camp at 5% and see what happens next. I'll be moving the other 5% into cash.
* **Don't** panic sell. The time for selling has long passed. You lost that opportunity when BTC was at $40k. Now you fucking HODL.
* **Do** stay the course. Whatever your investment strategy was, make sure to re-assess and keep investing. Slowly and deliberately.
* **Don't** try to time the market. You can't. If you didn't sell at the top, then you sure as shit aren't buying at the bottom.
* **Do** diversify going forward. There is no such thing as a ""guarantee"" in investing and there is no one ""true"" asset. Otherwise, we'd all be holding that one asset. All investments have risks of going to 0, never think otherwise.
* **Don't** beat yourself up. The bears are out in the woods today for a picnic and they'll be relentlessly mocking you. Every bear will suddenly be an expert who ""saw all this coming"" and they'll say that you were a fool to invest in ""tulip bulbs"". Unless those bears actually made money from this crash, they're just shit talking cowards.

There's more pain to come, folks. Much more. We're nowhere near max pain, so don't get brave yet. Bitcoin is an asset like any other. Don't fall in love with it, don't feel emotional about it. If it's keeping you up at night, maybe consider trimming it. Thanks for listening to my Ted Talk.","Everyone relax, it's just the entire financial market collapsing.",394

Bitcoin means far more to me than just a return on investment.

We all hear from Bitcoin skeptics constantly. But unfortunately, what they have to say is partially based on truth, just distorted through the lens of their perceptions.

I was very excited in 2017 and had a moment where I participated in the behavior of ""selling"" bitcoin instead of discussing the merits of the technology and the cypherpunk movement. I regret this, as I've seen it swallow much of the bitcoin community.

How often do we praise or parrot Michael Saylor? It's clear as day that Michael Saylor is selling a product. The way he presents Bitcoin stinks of a snake oil salesperson.

How often do we praise and parrot Andreas Antonopoulos? Andreas has remained objective and consistent with his critical thought.

How often do we praise Bitcoin Core or Lightning software engineers? Yet, they're putting in the work to make this a reality.

After this heavy crash, I hope we overwhelmingly return to discussions about the merits of the technology, its potential in the future, its potential flaws, and how this can truly impact our civilization, for better or worse.

I get that for a lot of people who went in hard in more recent times, who maybe thought this would be a straight road ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù, that right now might be a moment of extreme anxiety. And I also get that for every reasonably sensible, interested and careful investor there are a hundred ‚Äúbros‚Äù that annoy the fuck out of people, and folks like to see that type of person get their comeuppance.

But I don‚Äôt see any difference between what‚Äôs happening in the crypto markets to any of the rest of the financial sector right now: it‚Äôs all fucked. As an edge case, crypto is much more volatile, and for that reason we‚Äôre seeing the kinds of corrections going on right now. But it‚Äôs not going to just go to 0. There‚Äôs a huge, huge, huge amount of investment that has gone into crypto. 
Entrepreneur‚Äôs have gone in deep. Crypto is being used to pay for goods and services by ordinary people in lots of places across the world. Whole governments have gone into crypto. If we were to put it in terms of a clock, I think we‚Äôre still in the first few minutes of day 1 of cryptocurrency.

Whether it ends up being bitcoin by midday, or some other currency, I just don‚Äôt see it going away. Like any new technology, there will be bubbles and bursts, but an important thing to consider is that the internet is still here. Transformative technologies take time to become truly embedded and adopted - especially if there‚Äôs not an immediately apparent need for them on a large scale.

The ‚Äúinternet‚Äù was invented in 1969. I think we can all take a moment to relax, remind ourselves of the actual utility of cryptocurrency as a technology, and move forward with a bit less anxiety and manic energy. As early adopters, we could, potentially, stand to gain a decent return on our investments, but getting into constant a back and forth of buy/sell/is it dead/haha it‚Äôs dead does nobody any good.

Like any technology, bitcoin is only as valuable as it is useful. Remember the value of this coin beyond just the fiat value and I think (I hope) you‚Äôll be able to feel a little calmer. 

I feel like this sub has of late become less about learning about the technology than become a kind of tech /wsb 

It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúride the wave‚Äù or going ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù. It‚Äôs about doing your due diligence, understanding what you are investing in, not investing any more than you can afford to lose, asking questions, learning more, and remembering above all else that this is a technology that has a really profoundly positive potential - but like any technology, it‚Äôs about how we use, talk, and think about it. 

Peace, everyone x",A lot of weird energy in this sub right now‚Ä¶,39

It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúinflation could be coming!‚Äù Indicator. It‚Äôs an ‚Äúinflation already happened and this was the impact‚Äù.

‚Äúbitcoin is supposed to be a hedge to inflation!‚Äù

What do you think the 3k to 65k pump was? Do you think the fact that this coincided perfectly with the money supply doubling was a huge coincidence? bitcoin flying, home prices flying, stock market flying, all just a happy coincidence that had nothing to do with inflation? Come on. 
 
The market prices in *leading* indicators, not lagging indicators. It priced in the anticipation of inflation. What are we expecting now? A 75bps hike followed by multiple 50bps hikes. An attempt to tame inflation and strengthen the dollar. The market is pricing in the literal opposite of what it priced in throughout late 2020 and 2021. This is an attempt to ramp down inflation, not an attempt to ramp it up even further. 

If you looked at CPI and thought ‚Äúoh I can trade in front of inflation‚Äù you‚Äôre way late to the table and are totally misunderstanding what is happening right now. 

This isn‚Äôt about hedging inflation at this point, it‚Äôs about hedging a global recession, and any speculative asset is going to fall back hard in that scenario. Just take a look around the other equity markets. no one is saying ‚ÄúI thought a good asset like Amazon would go up from inflation!‚Äù It did. The entire market pumped hard as fuck.

Decentralisation. As an investor you have one job to do - make a choice about risk and put your wallet where your mouth is. Thats it.

This means you should probably look into what matters for an investment and why it exists.

Crypto is (or was, and after every bust cycles back to being) about decentralisation. If it is not decentralised, you are basically putting your money into a point system someone is running on Excel in their moms basement. They may have a very nice basement, and their mom may publish some good reviews of how tidy they keep their room, but that doesn‚Äôt make it decentralised. Banks often have marble basements, very respectable mothers, and even audit how tidy their room is but Bitcoin was created for a reason.

You were told this  every 3rd post or so on r/bitcoin.

Crypto is going to be huge, it already is. Even after this drop. It is literally the economic system of the future. Bitcoin will be worth much much more than 100k - how much more is more to do about the dollars risks than Bitcoins.

But before this happens, the wordcel debt scam market has to Darwinian self select out of the economic gene pool. You are seeing evolution unfold in real time, and hey - you participated as it happened. I hope you make it. You were told. Don‚Äôt worry, many others will also be told and fail to listen too. I also failed. But learned I could learn, this and time is what it took to recover.

My advice - Survive. Recognise your mistakes. Take crypto seriously. Learn to hate hero‚Äôs, personalities, debt and centralised systems. Brands and Name droppers have no place in your life‚Äôs attention. They never were your friend.

Earning interest is the slave chains that binds you to the system of debt and inflationary economics and comes at the expense of your freedom. If you have lost a lot of money from leverage or a platform shutdown / liquidity event / rug pull you now understand this in a way that you could not when you skimmed over reading in the bible that usury is bad.

DCA. HODL. Live your life. Never be concerned about using Bitcoin for the reason it exists - to live your life.

You can free yourself from debt slavery by choices you make. The more people do this, the more the world moves away from enslaving ours and our children‚Äôs futures for the benefit of the very few.

This is the wisdom of Bitcoin. Welcome to the front line of the future.","The one job of an investor, Bitcoin, debt slavery, and why market crashes are good for humanities future.",0

I was sitting in my grad lab with a lab mate, both of us up to our eyeballs in undergrad debt (I think I was around ~$70k). I had read about BTC before then and it sounded interesting, but  HolY SHiT what if we had bought it at $1! I went home and installed the BTC software. Immediately my laptop was on fire and unusable. Oh well, gave it the ol' college try. I felt underwater with the debt and didn't have ""investment"" money. Life went on.

I worked freelance on the side, I worked summers, trying to pay down that debt. I was not happy with my my PhD program so in 2013 I left and got a real job. My wife and I had big plans. House down payment + kids in the immediate future. I was very excited but still had this debt burden. I would watch BTC price at work, replaying that run to $100. I finay decided I couldn't not buy it now. I started buying BTC on credit through Coinbase. Small amounts at a time, and then a couple times whole BTC. It was money I knew I had but that I also felt should have been going to paying down my loans. I remember taking a long shit at work and pulling the trigger on multiple BTC fractional buys. My first kid was born and I decided I shouldn't keep doing this. I went back to paying my debts more aggressively. I ended up with around ~8.5 BTC, and I promised myself I wasn't touching it for at least 10 years.

Seeing it at $68k and above really tested me again. I have been fortunate that I didn't need to cash out. I've been incredibly lucky to afford the life I want, and knowing I had that BTC in cold storage added more mental security. At ATH I graced 7 figures between BTC and a couple ~fixed cap alts. I had to ask myself if I was still in this. What was I going to do at 10 years? Should I move it to ETFs?

It hasn't quite been 10 years yet, but here's the fucking answer: I'm averaging up. On to 10 BTC and then 21. Starting now I am back to buying daily.

I spent a lovely day at the park with my family launching model rockets. All of my girls had a blast despite none of the rockets reaching the moon. I read a lot of bullshit TA analysis and I have got to say, there is literally nothing that has changed my perspective on why we need BTC. My kids understand why our model rockets didn't reach the moon, but apparently these naysayers don't understand what we are trying to achieve here. I'm averaging up now, but maybe I'll end up averaging down. I don't know, nobody knows. But Let's Fucking GO!",Why I'm averaging up,40

Big mines have cheaper power, sure. But they didn‚Äôt get the miners for free. Not sure what kind of bulk purchase pricing bitmain offers on those, but even if you have 0.03$ kWh power and maybe paid 1900$/miner it would come to 14,244$ to mine one btc in one year. 

So as long as we‚Äôre above the production cost, there should be no reason to panic. If we go lower then 14,244$ it‚Äôs going to be one hell of a firesale.

""Well, if you do a TA on the trends, the market always does XYZ at this point.""

FFS, a history of fucking 13 years is NOT a history - it's a blip. A tiny little blip.

Yeah, I'm a bit shouty here, because the sheer hubris is mind bendingly stupid - because? Greed, as a human emotion, has no equal.

The entire market is like greed at it's most primal - and in that, it will self-destruct itself.
It'll eat itself up, in a feeding frenzy of vanishing returns.

13 years? - Jesus H Christmas, that's a TINY time scale - and the reason it hit such dizzying heights in the first place?
It was played with. Just another asset for the ""big boy &amp; girls"" to toy with, not giving a damn shit about any highfalutin crypto-bro drivel.
It was _there_ to be fucked with, to take the rubes for a ride, to make money out of _nothing_ expect taking money off other people.

And my story? I've followed this market since 2017, dabbled, speculated and ended up fortunately no worse off financially, but also wiser - I drank a tiny bit of the coolaid, I got a tiny bit greedy.

Out of all that experience? - yeah, I'd like to see some DeFi action _without_ speculation - I really would like more control over the money I actually own, because right now, it's all in the bank - and the bank calls the shots. I don't actually have custody over my own money, really.

Does anyone? - hell no.

This  post is about the utility and practicality of bitcoin. No, its not  about the electricity that it consumes either, but just the economics.

What  started as a more or less academic project to test a virtual global  currency has expanded far beyond its intended libertarian audience. A  ""revolutionary"" idea of a currency that is neither backed by a hard  metal, nor by an entire nation's economy. Only backed by its own  scarcity.

But can such a currency  that is backed by nothing ever be stable? I think not, and I'd like to  know if theres any reason to think that it might. Bitcoin might forever be subject to fluctuation given that the top 0.1% holders and miners are forever going to pump and dump. Because money itself is so centralized, these few will always hold more than half of its circulation. So in the spirit of  gambling, it is tempting to assume that bitcoin will either become the  currency of the world, or will just die. I don't think either needs to  be true, really.

Bitcoin has its  place in history as the first of the cryptocurrencies. These are  expected by many to storm the world and eventually take over finances,  verification, connected devices and internet of things, which is  expected to be a market worth trillions of dollars in only a few years.  Bitcoin's heritage will most certainly live on. But not forget that at  the end of the day, its the scope and utility of cryptocurrencies that  will decide the direction of their adoption.

Further,  a currency that spans across the globe and remains same in value  everywhere has a fundamental fallacy. There are economies that are doing  great, and there are countries with civil wars and exploding  starvation. By demanding that a currency remain constant across all  these places, you essentially ""take"" from the improving countries and  ""give"" to the struggling ones. The ""givers"" would probably not be too  happy about it. But well, thats the whole point of having different  currencies for different nations.

At  the end of the day, we cannot expect bitcoin to solve all the world's  problems and take over everything. Sure it will linger on. It will pump  and dump. Have fun with it. But just dont expect too much from it.",Please don't expect too much from Bitcoin,2

One of my basic theories about cryptocurrencies is that they suffer from the Highlander problem.

""There can be only one""

Basically, I can't imagine that there will really be room for a large number of digital mediums of exchange in the future.

Because of network effects and the fact that businesses have to set prices in that currency, do accounting in that currency, etc...

So, does a general crash of the crypto market, which could wipe out many smaller market cap coins, essentially focus those resources on the larger market cap coins (like bitcoin) and accentuate the network effects that they enjoy?",Does a Crypto crash benefit bitcoin?,0

Ever since 30k I have been buying small amounts every drop and have added 65% more sats since this dip and have spread it out at 18 buys all the way down. I just bought my biggest buy at 19k of .1 btc and feel really really good about that number vs long term.

I am in the camp btc is either going to $0

The Bitcoin Network will continue to work, doesn't matter how high or low the current price is.

Everyone claiming that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value should ask themselves if they really did enough research on the Bitcoin Network.
Nothing has an intrinsic value.
But Bitcoin gives everyone on this planet a free and easy to use swiss banking account that can't be manipulated by governments.

6.5 Billion people on the earth do not have a Banking account or are living under authoritarian regimes that could freeze their bank accounts or steal their money anytime. 
That's impossible with Bitcoin and that's the reason why organisations like the Human Rights Foundation are supporting the use and development of the Bitcoin Network.

Bitcoin gives everyone worldwide a new technology to safe their money outside of the current money system.

Just because you are living with financial privilege does not mean that everyone in the world has the same financial opportunities and freedom like you.

The Bitcoin Network also enables us a new kind of internet which isn't controlled by big tech companies, where you are fully in control of your own data and everything is open source. The native currency of this Network is Bitcoin, not Dollar or Euro. 
And I'm not talking about Web 3 which is just an illogical mess covered by cool buzzwords. 


Many people, even those who already invested in Bitcoin don't really understand the importance of it, which leads to panik because of falling prices (which happens all the time over the years...).

The people who did hundreds of hours of research on Bitcoin are happy about this low prices. They won't sell. 

The Bitcoin Network is technically stronger than ever before and continues to grow rapidly 
(hashrate all time highs, Taro Protocol, exponential lightning adoption, Strike payments in the US, Apps like Sphinx Chat, better distribution of Bitcoin, Web 5 and much more...).

We are still early and it's going to take many years for Bitcoin to eventually become mainstream.

It's spending about $6.1 trillion a year right now.

This leaves a deficit of approx. $1.9 trillion.

This is all added to the $30 trillion in debt it already has.

Well, what happens when you raise rates? You typically slow the economy and decrease your tax revenues.

And if rates are higher, then the cost on your debt increases.

So we're in a situation where the central bankers are going to slow down the largest economy in the world and simultaneously pay more interest on their debt.

This will increase annual deficits further and faster unless spending is cut aggressively (not going to happen!) which ultimately leads to a debt death spiral.

So...

Good luck with that.

Yes, crypto market is crashing and yes, Bitcoin broke many key levels, 20k included.

That, my friends, does not mean a lot if you: 

1 - managed your risk

Cryptocurrencies are one of the riskiest assets you can find, maybe THE RISKIEST. Y'all should have known that before investing what you can't afford or, worst, throwing your life savings on it.

Bitcoin is the less volatile among cryptos, and it is still a wild rollercoaster moved by a lot of powerful forces in the game. Betting fear money on it is FOOLISH.

2 - built a solid strategy

Like I previously mentioned, cryptos are very risky. So it is always raccomended that you are never all in on cryptos, but you should have some other assets in your portfolio. (and some liquidity to limit volatility)

That means you should have studied a well defined portfolio and entry strategy BEFORE you start investing, otherwise you'll get rekt by these huge movements and you'll nevere make it in this market.

By entry strategy I mean that you should plan how do you want to build your position on a particular asset. You have a long term goal? Fine, you could implement a monthly DCA in your strategy. You want to be in the market for a small period? You could study how to TRADE the market, managing risk and position sizing accordingly, studying TA and be all in liquidity.

You have plenty of option to invest OR speculate in this environment, just don't EVER improvise on financial markets and don't mix investing and speculation, you'll get blown out.

No foundamentals have changed, so there's no rational reason to sell BTC at these prices. All the selling pressure is moved by emotional or improvised ""investors"", liquidated gamblers and powerful istitutions.

All the FUD I'm seeing these days is 99.9% of the time from people who were not prepared to overcome times like that, and let me tell you that in a risky environment like cryptos, it's pretty naive.

Now that you're grieving, be sure to have learned something, so you'll be ready for the next cycle.

If you're not willing to do so, just quit, try something else. Crypto investing ain't for you.",Reasons why many people got destroyed by this market movements.,3

Here's a question: in equities, pricing is the midpoint of the Bid and Ask. Bid being the highest limit buy order, and Ask being the lowest limit sell order.

1) as the saying always goes ‚Äúdo not invest more than what you can afford to lose‚Äù. Yes, BTC is very low at this point hovering around 19k but that doesn‚Äôt guarantee that it will sky rocket again ‚Ä¶it can go up or it can go down further. Just because there has been cycles of bear market and bull market twice in the last 5 years doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs going to another super hyper bull market taking BTC to 100k or even 50k. While there is a possibility there‚Äôs no guarantee for any price. So take the risk what you can afford to lose. That‚Äôs it. Nothing more unless you wanna burn your fingers 

2) people who encourage big institutions or companies to buy more Bitcoin on Twitter or other platforms‚Ä¶no just no‚Äîdon‚Äôt do that!! You‚Äôre essentially creating a more risky situation by asking a few whales to accumulate more of Bitcoin which is not Bitcoin was invented for! Whether it is Michael Saylor or Elon Musk or Nayib Bukele, the reality is these people can be true to their words and never sell their BTC , but not everyone surrounding them feel that way. What if tomorrow Michael Saylor is not anymore and Microstrategy is taken over by another CEO? The new CEO might not hold the same vision or perception as Michael Saylor , and if the company is forced to sell their BTC , it can create a massive spiralling downward crisis. BTC is created for us, the common people who are fed up with centralised government and authoritarian financial system. Not to be held by few whales or companies in which case it essentially becomes centralised in a way

3) Carl the moon, MM crypto, bit boy rest of the shillers who shill BTC to 100k and ask you to go long or leverage-posting massive gains at every opportunity, well folks they have all made their wealth and cashed out their principal capital amount back in the their bank account safe and sound. Let this be clear in your minds-They have all got absolutely nothing to lose anymore. Stop following their trade or tweets and actions. 

4) Moonbois and noobs and rest who are super positive-well here‚Äôs the truth. For every seller there need to be a buyer. Bitcoin won‚Äôt pump your wallet just because there‚Äôs a halving event happening every 4 years or only 21 million BTC exists creating a scarcity. There need to be enough people in the world who believe in decentralisation and feel Bitcoin is the better way of achieving decentralisation and will achieve a better stability in future rather than being highly volatile. 

5) And last but not the least, you got those people who say ‚ÄúI am in it purely for technology‚Äù, technology my foot, don‚Äôt do something based on those bullocks from others. While do think blockchain technology is amazing, nearly every single person who bought BTC at any price is definitely concerned about his investment. They may not talk about it or seeming not be worried in public but at the back of their mind it‚Äôs always there. No one ever buys or invests on something knowingly that they are going to lose money. Everyone wants to profit.

To have invented (and then tended to) something that had the ability to change the world forever, but then have the wisdom to step aside, is quite unique. He/she realised the need for this to be leaderless. This is not just a small detail that would mean bitcoiners/nodes didn't defer to his/her judgement on decisions, but that in the decades to come, when people take back control of their money, they will know it's truly theirs, and that no single person has influence over it. It would also mean there was no ability for bitcoin to be coerced, an unparalleled trait imo. For most, the promise of fame and fortune would have been too great. 

To have left those coins untouched too is amazing. Of course it's too soon to say for certain, but I'd wager these never move. This is because for Satoshi, I don't think this was ever about enrichment in the worldly sense, but rather in the achievement of a global freedom tool. No amount of money to one person with this vision is worth the strength of the belief in the network. 

The hope for humanity that he/she gave me through the invention of bitcoin is hard to describe. But perhaps writing this while being net down in my investments over the last 2 years is a good way of illustrating just how hopeful I remain.

Then new cycle started with huge bulls and lasereyes chasing away the bears and Bitcoin started raising once again, 2 years later and at the sunny year 2021 the ATH was close to $69K. The amazing Bitcoin had raised not by a tenfold but over 20 times from the heinous bear market. People were happy but also greedy. They wanted to it break $100K too fast and too early.

The author likens it to gold due to its high stock-to-flow ratio and the inability of governments to control its supply and create inflation by producing additional amounts on a whim.

I‚Äôll leave reviewing the book for a different post, except to say that it‚Äôs overall been a good read, and an engaging overview of the history of money, albeit with some kooky ideas: the author believes unsound fiat money is to blame for everything from World War II to (no joke) twerking.

I want to address the feasibility of the book‚Äôs central premise instead. According to the author, the creation of banknotes redeemable in gold is a fundamentally sound idea, and the problem with gold standard was that central banks‚Äô takeover of the system resulted in the production of more paper money than justified by the reserves they held.

Ammous argues that Bitcoin is superior to gold in that the yearly increase in its reserves is smaller and completely predictable, and that transactions can be executed without government interference and bank intermediaries that create counterparty risk. It is a synthetically scarce asset.

For Bitcoin to be a store of value (one of the three key components of money, the other two being medium of exchange and unit of account), its price needs to stabilize. This would happen with a very high holdings-to-transactions ratio.

But a widespread adoption is essentially impossible: Bitcoin does not have a high enough transaction throughput to support the needs of a global economy. So the author proposes that the majority of transactions be executed off-chain, using banknote-like tokens, while the actual blockchain settlements are performed by central bank-like entities who issue the tokens.

Therein lies my problem with the entire concept: by removing the trustless nature of the blockchain, we are back to the exact same problem we started with: second-layer central banks are the very thing that supposedly destroyed the gold standard. Since the transactions would be off-chain, these institutions would presumably be subject to some of the same kinds of laws and regulations as banks dealing with fiat money.

If Bitcoin (or another similar cryptocurrency) were adopted globally, the world‚Äôs governments wouldn‚Äôt be able to confiscate it like gold, but they could control the banks‚Äô behavior. And even if they couldn‚Äôt, the customers would have to trust that these digital banks wouldn‚Äôt cheat or perform rug pulls, which is something we‚Äôve already seen happen time and time again with DeFi, and which is much easier with pseudonymity.

So what say you? Could Bitcoin ever become a global reserve currency without being subject to the same kinds of problems that destroyed the gold standard? Are second layer trust issues solvable? As of now, I remain skeptical.",The Bitcoin Standard - Feasibility of Bitcoin as a reserve currency,0

Personally, I am looking for around $150k price point. Once we hit this, then I would have enough to sell and pay off all debt/mortgages on multiple real estate rental  assets. This in turn, would provide guaranteed rent profits/cash flow to live off for the rest of my life. 

I would plan to hold onto 3 whole bitcoin for my kids.

It would be hard to part with any of it, but this plan makes the most sense to me. The cash flow on my 
rental portfolio without having mortgages would be upwards of $100k cashflow a month. 
This just feels like the conservative way to do things.

Obviously I know BTC will very likely go far higher than $150k, but It would be hard to hodl once it reqches the prices that would secure my financial freedom for life.

I'll continue buying more like a crazy person at these current prices. We've all been dreaming of prices like this for 2 years. I hope it goes to 15k or even 10k. If it does,  I'll be able to stack the remaining BTC I need to reach my above plan.

For the newbies I urge you to move your bitcoin into a decentralized wallet. You don't actually own any bitcoin on these platforms. In simple terms, it's an IOU from these exchanges to grant you your bitcoin. One of the advantages of bitcoin is that you are essentially your own bank. This also means there's no FDIC to ensure you get your money in the event of bankruptcy. I would hate for anyone to lose their hard earned money, especially from no fault of their own. Don't put your faith in these exchanges, none of us know their true legitimacy and protection. Setting up a wallet is much more simple than you may think. Visit bitcoin.org and it will literally walk you through the process. 5 minutes later and you'll be good to go. Ideally, you would want to get a hardware wallet, but this does require a purchase. I'm mostly speaking to investors that don't have much skin in the game. If you did i'd hope you already know this. Bitcoin Ogs, please don't come at me in the comments. I don't see enough posts for new comers and i'm just trying to simplify everything. Hopefully this helped some people out thereüëç Keep stacking",PSA Please move your bitcoin off of exchanges and into a wallet.,289

Have to be honest though, lots of people talking about never reaching below previous ATH or pre-halving lows.

in other words lots of capitulation and doubt these days. 

Here are my concerns and please prove my points wrong because there are some flaws and issues I see going forward. 

- BTC falls below halving ATH. Issue? Why? Support falls out and it dumps? Why would it not recover like previous cycles?
- Adoption - failing? price dump fucks over el Hodledor? do collapses of these economy put a black stain on BTC that‚Äôs unrecoverable? are we all using BTC wrong by holding as investment and not spending as $? Do we have to wait for hypernization and it to be worth millions+ s Saylor says for it to lose volatility and stabilize? How do we overcome this issue?
- Quantum computing - endangers Crypto in general- obvious threat.
- regulation- looking favourable. Assuming it‚Äôs property/currency what is the issue here? 
- govts issue CBDC‚Äôs(no better/worse than Fiat) and the convince the world it‚Äôs better than BTC. 

The long of the short is - if the fundamentals (more users, more adoption, stronger network, etc) are happening (are they?) how do we fail?

I see so many people who are smarte than me arguing about fundamentals of money and economic Systems like Keynes V the Austrians and there are pros/cons to both. So how do we move forward from here? Is this shit viable or a pipe dream? Please no Buttcoin BS comments.

My goal is to invest in Bitcoin (long-term, meaning: even years. Everything takes time), but first I want to learn about it more, analyze the risks before making any move. Note that I haven't made an investment in my life, but was always interested in it, I just did not know how and where to start. Now I feel like I should give it a chance. I would appreciate if you could provide me some information about what is Bitcoin, the history behind it and the possible future. What it means for regular people, what will it mean to society as a whole.  


Things that I know is that Bitcoin could fundamentally change the perspective of how we view and use money in the future, and that any crypto, including BTC is digital money, but I guess there is much more. You can also drop/suggest some useful sites, reliable sources where I can gather as much info as I can to make my decision.

You and your lovely wife share a Bitcoin wallet, we'll call it the ""common"" wallet, and you both know the 12 word key.  One day her mother decides you aren't good enough, divorce time.  The judge says the wallet shall be divided, with half the Bitcoin going to her exclusive wallet(where only she has the keys), and half to yours.  And so it is done.  

But then one day, a tenant who was making automatic payments to the common wallet, accidentally sends another one there.  Well, both you and the ex have keys to that wallet, and as we know NYKNYC.  So...who gets the Bitcoin?  It would come down to who is quickest on the trigger, wouldn't it?  Or whoever sees it first or is made aware of it in time to quickly log in, and send that Bitcoin to their exclusive wallet.  

My question is - for situations such as this, can a rule be set up in say, Ledger Live app, wherein any payment received in the wallet can be automatically and immediately sent to another wallet?  So that you don't have to worry about the ex stealing it.  Because you can never stop her from having the keys, she's already got those.  And so any payment made to that wallet, you've got to constantly worry about it and be checking it, to ensure you don't lose any money.  Right?  

If no rule can be set up, can you guy see how this could be a problem?","What happens if you and your ex-wife split the Bitcoin wallet, but someone makes a payment to the old wallet?

I'm encountering a problem with buying/selling BTC from both the Coinbase Pro website and the Coinbase Pro app. I have no problem logging in, it's just that the Buy/Sell buttons have been disabled (see attached screenshot).

As I'm getting rather frustrated with Coinbase Pro support chatbot, I was hoping anyone here could give some clue of what to do. I don't want to miss out on this BTC sale.

I have a 401k (pre-tax, sadly) that I would like to rollover into a self-directed, self custody IRA. I have looked at options like unchained capital, which is nice in that it's 2 of 3 multisig (i hold 2), but it costs 1k to set up + $250 annual fee.  And I have to do that for each ira i set up (roth, traditional, workplace, etc). Furthermore I can't trade (which is probably a good thing, just forces BTC and chill), but it'd be nice to have optionality of holding in cash vs BTC when at an obvious top.

I've looked into Directed IRA (https://directedira.com/) and it's cheaper, and you can trade, but it's also custodied by gemini.

I want full control, full optionality, full custody. And for cheap!

There MUST be cheaper options. Anyone can direct me?

Bitcoin is currently produced at 900 newly mined Bitcoin per day. Future contracts for next month allow 27,000 Bitcoins to be sold before they are even mined. This add huge supply pressure and when futures stretch 4 months on the CME that a extra 108,000 BTC in advance. The good news is production of new supply decreases in the future, unlike tulips.

So think about this. At the peak $69,000 the Bitcoin Futures ETF launched. I'm willing to bet that that caused the crash. Four months of futures at that price would have been a additional $7,452,000,000 USD worth of bitcoin added to the market. Now it all makes sense why wall street and the SEC wanted a bitcoin futures ETF, but not a spot price ETF. They wanted to crash the price of bitcoin by adding more supply onto the market. However this only a short term effect, not a long term effect as the bitcoin supply output decreases over time.",Futures casued the tulip bubble to crash and i think they caused bitcoin to crash too.,29

At the start I loved the idea of a new currency like this but when it started to be seen more and more as some kind of 'get rich' thing I stopped buying it and from there I watched the spikes, the dips, all of it.

Some of you have to help me here. Why is everyone losing their minds over the ""crash"" of the cost to buy bitcoin? How is this even remotely relevant to bitcoin as a currency?

Bitcoin is not an internet stock or an investment and those who try to use it as one are currently realizing why that wasn't a smart idea. Bitcoin is a currency, plain and simple. You use it to buy things, plain and simple, but for the last decade+ it's been nonstop ""HODL!!1"" mantras and essays on why you should never even think about selling or using your btc.

The same thing you could buy last week or last month or last year with bitcoin you can still buy with bitcoin. The price fluctuations in terms of how much USD it costs to buy BTC should not matter. I'm honestly vexed why the mods of this sub even allow it? The vast majority of posts I see on here relate to ""investment"" and ""cold storage"" and basically every topic that involves *not* utilizing bitcoin for its actual intended purpose. It's like if /r/podiatry was overtaken by foot fetishists.

imo the guy who bought that first pizza with bitcoin is smarter than all the crypto ""investor"" bros laughing at him combined. He actually understood what bitcoin was and got tons of people to take an interest in it and to realize that yes, you can actually buy stuff with it - it's actual currency. And yet so many of you still don't get it. You have to explain this to me. You really think this is the smart thing to do in life? To try to make a profit off of bitcoin? This is the best idea you've come up with to make some extra money?",Sorry but please help me understand something,140

We say that data type in blockchains is immutable, but that works only when a block is complete, cause blockchains work with the linked list system so in order to complete a block at least a specific amount of data is required (example 5 transactions), until there arent 5 transactions in a block the block isnt complete, that means its hash isnt used to start the next block, so in this case wouldnt the transactions inside the box be mutable ? Since the block isnt complete and its hash isnt created till now ?

Everything about it is quite vast and complicated I want something wjere I can read about every process in detail, I am trying to create a sample blockchain, so thats where questions keep coming up.

This ""anyone buying crypto is going to win"" stance is just inherently wrong.

The ""well, anyone who buys and holds will win"" is also something that's not guaranteed to happen. It's only true if more people keep putting more money into Bitcoin, but there's no law of nature that says that will happen. Bitcoin doesn't just inherently becomes more valuable over time, in dollar terms.

Yes, Bitcoin has performed incredibly well in the past, but that doesn't prove that it will in the future. There's an endless amount of stocks and bubbles that did very well up to a point, and then they didn't.","Someone can only make a profit (in dollar terms) off Bitcoin, if someone else makes a loss (in dollar terms) off Bitcoin",0

1. I couldn‚Äôt find good resources on ‚Äûnodes‚Äú in the btc network. From my understanding there are ‚Äûminers‚Äú and different kind of nodes (including light nodes, full nodes and other kinds of nodes) which are all doing similar things just in different ‚Äûdepth‚Äú. From my understanding they are checking that the transaction maker has enough btc to send, place the transaction in the mempool and at the end check that new block is correct and add them to their local copy of their blockchain

2. Miners just ‚Äûpropose‚Äú new blocks, the other nodes (excluding miners) check the result by hashing the block with the already found nonce and then need to agree, right? 

3. How exactly do more miners lead to more decentralisation? Is it just because it‚Äôs harder to ‚Äûshutdown‚Äú the network, which is harder with 10000 miners than with 10?

4. Even tho more miners mean more decentralisation, it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with security, does it?
From what I understand, security is provided by the nodes because they check the correctness of the block, thus block doublespending etc‚Ä¶

5. How does a 51% attack work? If someone has 51% of mining power, they could create new blocks, which would not be approved by the nodes, thus it wouldn‚Äôt get on the blockchain, would they?

Thanks in advance",Some question to the BTC network,2

I disagree, being forced to denominate something in capped asset would be really, really bad.

For the discussion let me paint the hypothetical picture.

It is year 2080. You own 100BTC and you are entrepreneurial and have an idea for innovative mean of transport. You want to make it a reality so you start to make calculations. Setting up production and processes gonna cost you 80BTC. For remaining 20BTC you buy first raw materials, hire people etc. Factory can produce 10k vehicles a year. Your margin is 20%

In first year income is 24BTC and cost of materials, fixed cost and labor etc.  20BTC/ year. 4 BTC profit yay!

2nd year:  you need to decrease prices though, because BTC amount is finite and it is more valuable every year, but raw materials prices are falling as well. Your costs were 19BTC, but income 22.8BTC (20% margin). 3.8 BTC profit.

Then situation repeats. In year 3 your profit is 3.6BTC, year 4 - 3.45BTC. After 20 years your profit is less than 1 BTC, despite the fact you are producing different, upgraded model. You start to calculate if your investment made sense. You see that on average your yearly profit was 2.5BTC. So in 20 years it was 50 BTC. You can sell your factory now for 20 BTC. You have 70 BTC now. In 20 years you produced 200,000 vehicles and lost 30 BTC on it. You wish you never did anything productive for humanity and only kept your BTC‚Ä¶

In short time such situation repeats. Everybody else realizes the same and quickly it appears in 2100 that computer technology staled for past 20 years, economy is not developing at all, because everybody is holding Bitcoin‚Ä¶ only food producers and developers prosper because people need to eat and live somewhere‚Ä¶

I believe everything can‚Äôt be capped to an asset that doesn‚Äôt produce anything. Bitcoin will be store of value but only to some level (maybe replacing gold). But that‚Äôs the limit and never again we will have currency pegged to single asset.","[Debate] Never again there will be currency reserve by gold, Bitcoin etc.",0

Yield farming by definition is any effort to put 'Crypto' (*Bitcoin - not Crypto*) assets to work to generate returns on said assets.

However, as Bitcoin's value as pristine collateral increases. The risk of lending it out to 3rd parties who rehypothecate via risky fractional reserve lending tactics - inflating and manipulating the market by selling paper bitcoin whilst absorbing real world bitcoin demand, will become too great.

Something else to consider is that even if you are a complete Bitcoin Maxi - offering up your BTC to a DeFi platform who dabbles in shit-coinery exposes you to far greater counterparty risk; relative to the quality &amp; stability of the other shit-coin 'networks' these DeFi platforms offer financial instruments against.

Although it may not be economically viable just yet. The Lightning Network currently offers the only method to lock up BTC (by providing liquidity when opening channels) with the ability to earn real BTC yields via transaction fee's, without any counterparty risk.

I honestly believe this will play a pivotal role in the adoption and expansion of the lightning network and in Bitcoins evolution from from store of value to a true medium of exchange.",OPINION: The Lightning Network will be the future of DeFi 'yield farming' for BTC.,21

The problem I have is: I can't afford a hardware wallet. Actually I can, but I'd have to spend all my BTC on that, so it'd be kinda of useless. Yeah, I don't have much money, but I live in a third world country, so the little I have is significant.

Now, I don't mind too much leaving it on the exchange company, but I'd prefer having my own seed. But I also don't want to use a hot wallet.

Considering that, I had an idea. I'd generate a key offline, write it down on a paper, and then delete whatever I used to generate that key. I'd also of course save the address of that wallet. Now, as far as I know, a hardware wallet is only a means of storing the key offline and sign transactions. With this idea, I wouldn't be able to sign transactions, but it would be a safe storage, right? And in the future, whenever I want to get that money back, I could just restore my wallet and spend it, right? The only problem I see is that I wouldn't be able to generate a key without leaving any track at all, would that be a big problem?

I just happened to sell my car at the time it dipped within a price range I could actually afford to be whole.

My secondary hobby is buying and flipping cars. It's almost like playing with stocks, except I can expect profits within weeks instead of years. To summarize, I travel out of state to buy cars that are priced lower than market value. I bring these cars back home locally and flip them for profit. It's not a bad gig if you don't mind the travel time and expenses, but the end profits more then make up for it. I'm also a hobby mechanic, so I am usually pretty good at sorting out junk. So it's not like I'm gambling with a clunker and getting stuck with it if it happened to break down on me. Anyways, I'm veering off subject now... But with flipping vehicles, I usually continue to work with my profits and purchase another car, rinse and repeat with flipping, etc. 

Well, my dilemma is continuing my tried and true method of flipping cars for profits, or investing this money in a full bitcoin with some change. Obviously Bitcoin is going to climb back up, but I'm curious in what you all would recommend from your perspective if you fell into this exact situation. 

Also, I wouldn't mind hearing what your favorite platform is with purchasing Bitcoin. I have fractions of Bitcoin on multiple apps that I've never really seen the effort of grouping them together since they're such small amounts.

The problem as I see it is that if you set up a mobile / desktop wallet to self custody then you have to write the 12 word phrase down somewhere. So if you keep it at home, someone may locate it -  **Physical Risk**

OK so we are told to get a hardware wallet so your keys are not online. Well guess what you still have to write down the 12/24 words somewhere. - **Physical Risk**

So one of my other friends took a photo of his words and put in amongst 10 years of photos on google drive... yes this may be a fairly effective way of hiding it but now you have - **Digital Risk** 

So as I understand it a hardware wallet like ledger can be restored onto another wallet or hardware device using the 12/24 words so its really important to keep these safe.

MultiSig you say... Got it! except you have the same above issues for multisig for each wallet plus you need to store a configuration file that also has to be kept safe. - **Digital &amp; Physical Risk**

Which brings me to Multisig using a 3rd party which seems to have some advantages.

There are Services like [Keys.casa](https://Keys.casa) that enable you to have a 2 of 3 multisig with their server as the 3rd signiture... You could combine a key on your phone with a hardware wallet and them having a key. This seems to mitigate both Digital &amp; Physical Risk as even if someone got access to your phone they would also need access to your hardware wallet or recovery phrase to get your bitcoin... but its not free its a paid service.

Also there is Blockstream Green Wallet and while it doest seem to get that much love you can use it with a Ledger hardware wallet in a 2 of 2 multisig. This service enables you to use 2FA such as a yubikey or other typical 2FA. 

As far as I can tell the Blockstream Green wallet is the best option for free as you could safely write your 12/24 wallet recovery down in a locked note stored on your computer as even if someone got access to it and was able to restore the hardware wallet they would not see any bitcoin as they would also need to have access to the 2FA ... something like a yubikey. Which of course then becomes easier to distribute backup keys and hardware wallets to geographically seperate locations.

Yes its true its not permission less and this means a 3rd part is involved if you take this route but as 99% don't trust them self with self custody Green Wallet combined with Ledger Hardware Wallet and Yubikeys appear to me to be the best option for the slightly paranoid.

Is my logic flawed? or better options?",Exchange Risk vs Physical Risk vs Digital Risk,2

If you can ""earn"" 2-3% a year, fully risk free, in spending power on your saved money/wealth, there's very little reason for larger holders of wealth or banks to risk that money by investing in new businesses and inventions. They'd just hoard it and go to the beach. Fear of losing 2-3% a year to inflation is what keeps modern banks lending to new business and mortgages at a higher rate in order to make the money productive.

There would still be some business investment in a fully deflationary society but it would be severely slowed compared to things today. 

There's a good place for bitcoin and crypto and the technologies they give us to function along side existing financial models. I just see no actual benefit in using them or pushing them as a replacement. In a forever deflationary system, the original rich basically stay the only rich forever and over a long period of time (decades or more) you'd just end up with a far more angry crowd of young people and working class than exist today, with far greater inequality. And justifiably so.

Not even 19.1 million out of 8 billion people on this world, out of 1.7 billion of the ""rich"" western world. 

Not even 19.1 million people using their earnings, which should be well above $20k yearly, to buy enough bitcoin to become a wholecoiner. These are the times to make decisions. For decisions that are made in times like these, are life-changing decisions.

Over 1 million subscribers, but most of the people are playing here as if $100 is a lot of money. When I was a kid I thought that was a lot of money. But seriously, as an adult you should know better. There's trillions of these 'numbers on a paper' out there. $100 is not a lot, it's more like the average tip you should give the waitress at a decent restaurant. 

Bitcoin is at $20k, people.. What else can you buy with $20k? A house? No. A decent car? No. You can't buy anything with $20k. Everything that's really useful is a lot more expensive than $20k. Even $20k is literally nothing. 

You could've saved up more than $20k to buy 1 bitcoin, but instead you chose to go to parties, to smoke, to work at McDonald's, to go on vacations, all to just please your own egocentric pleasure instead of improving the world for your own future and future generations by transitioning to a superior financial system. 

All you have to do is buy 1 BTC and take it off the exchange. That's all. Is it really to much to ask? I don't think so. If you don't have $20k laying around somewhere, you should really reflect on your life, decisions and priorities.

Think long-term. You should have the heroic mentality to be able to sacrifice 1 year of your life. Only 1 year of minimalism, will give you the rest of your life without any financial worries.

This can also be viewed as the stages of the ""death of a fiat currency"". Money can be seen as serving 3 roles. It is a medium of exchange, it is a store of value, and it is a unit of accounting. As we move through the stages of hyperinflation the money gradually gives up these 3 roles. Once it has given up all 3, it is dead.

1. Government spending gets out of control to where deficit is 40% or more of spending and debt is over 80% of GNP. If this is for a war that the markets believe will be won and ended so that the government can make drastic cuts in spending, then there is some wiggle room in these numbers.
2. This goes on for a couple years and investors move towards shorter-term bonds.
3. It becomes clear the deficit is not going back down.
4. The central bank starts buying up government debt with newly made money. If they are not naturally inclined to do this, the government changes the laws or people running the central bank. For the rest of this section, I will write as if the central bank were just part of the government and ignore bond certificates printed by the government and handed to the central bank as these will become worthless anyway. With this simplification, I will just say, ""the government prints money"".
5. There is capital flight out of that currency and bond sales fail. If **the government let bond interest rates rise to attract bond buyers, the interest payments on the debt would be huge compared to taxes collected**, so they keep interest rates down by printing more money. However, the private investors become less and less inclined to ""roll over"" their government bonds.
6. Government is forced to print money to cover their budget and inflation picks up. The more bonds coming due the worse the printing is. Many short-term bonds can make for huge amounts of printing, even more than the regular budget.
7. Some people notice prices going up and spend their money before prices go up more, even for things they don't need yet. The velocity of money picks up. People start to realize that the local currency is not a good store of value, though still used for transactions. Some people start to use foreign currencies or Bitcoin as a store of value.
8. So many people take money out of their bank accounts and exchange it for a foreign currency, or Bitcoin, or just buy something, which puts banks in danger of going under. So the government often freezes bank accounts. This is very bad for the account holders, both because times are hard and they can't get their money, and also because by the time they are able to get their money, it is worth much less.
9. Wages and prices become indexed to something more stable, like a foreign currency or Bitcoin. So the local currency is losing the ""unit of account"" function. Wages become paid more often, like weekly or daily, instead of monthly. The velocity of money picks up more.
10. People start to use a foreign currency or Bitcoin as store of value, even though the government may forbid it. The black market starts in currency exchange.
11. Interest rates are very high and loans are for much shorter periods. Loans may be for a couple months instead of 30 years. Hyperinflation makes for hard times and many people are forced to sell their their land or house. Because of these things the real prices for things usually bought with long-term loans can drop in terms of something like Bitcoin. Houses may usually be bought with a bag of some foreign currency. Real estate is very different during hyperinflation and normal times.
12. People start to use barter or a foreign currency or Bitcoin for trade, even though the government forbids it. This is a growing black market for commerce. If you trade a fish you caught for some potatoes your friend grew, neither of you is paying any taxes on the deal. In general, once people are breaking the law by using a foreign currency for trade, they don't pay any taxes on trade either. The black market is tax free.
13. Being tax free and with better store of value, the black market eventually grows larger than the legal market. People no longer worry about the government requirement to use local paper currency, enforcement is impossible.
14. A business that follows the law and sells for regulated prices in the local currency cannot buy enough new inventory and soon goes out of business. This makes the percentage of the economy that is black market go up.
15. People start to not want to accept the local paper money. Regular taxes are down because hyperinflation has devastated the economy and much of the economy is now in the ""black market"". The government is finding it hard to buy things by printing money, as so much of the economy has moved to the black market. It is finding it hard to pay employees enough for them to live comfortably, even though it keeps printing more all the time. The government is losing economic power. Tax collectors may be skipping work to tend to their own vegetable garden. There is a very real risk of the government failing at this step.
16. At this point, the government has some hard choices if it is not going to fail. It needs to do something so that the ""black market"" is legalized and taxable, and deficits are nearly eliminated. It could just legalize a foreign currency or Bitcoin. But then it would forever give up on collecting any ""inflation tax"". It could get rid of budget deficits and stop printing money. However, people will still fear that it could start again at any time and so be hesitant to use that money. I think the most frequent end to hyperinflation is by making a new fiat money but with enough governmental changes that bring deficits and inflation under control, people will use the new money. If they switch to a new currency then the old money is no longer used as a store of value, or unit of account, or even as a medium of exchange. It has died.",Stages Of Hyperinflation - USA is at stage #5,9

post,vdqi56,2s3qj,bitcoin,false,1655398515,https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/vdqi56/why_is_this_so_profound/,self.bitcoin,,"I have been studying bitcoin for several months now trying to find any evidence or flaw in the design and history of this technology. The further you go down the rabbit hole, the more certain you become that BTC has the potential to change every facet of our current society and culture. The consequences of ingrained unquestioning of the monetary system has been all that we know. Repeated cycles of boom and bust whereas each bust is a bit worst than the previous one. Crisis after crisis, we find a way to generate more credit and kickstart the boom cycle to avoid short term pain and systemic collapse.

We have existed only knowing an inflationary way of doing things. More credit, more consumption, and more capital that constantly loses its purchasing power are all supposedly the signs of a healthy economy? How come we assume as truth that a 2% inflation target is what a healthy economy needs? Are we really that confident deflationary capital that incentivizes us to save rather than spend, would surely be the downfall of our global economy?

We cant conceive of a deflationary reality because we assume that monetary technology and systems never can or will change.

Modern economics has neglected the very fabric of the system in which it attempts to model and predict. This is akin to a marine biologist studying all the different ways in which fish interact and behave while never even for a fucking second asking what is water. The degenerate economist will never question money itself, it will only ever question the ways in which we distribute and allocate that money. Couldn't the nature of the money be the problem? Could this nature dictate how we deal with policy and economic issues in ways we are not even fully conscious of?

What if money had no centralized entity that could arbitrarily decide supply, or if there was no centralized authority deciding who gets a loan and who does not?

BTC does not care if you are black, white, woman, man, republican, democrat, liberal, conservative. BTC represents a different future. I am still unsure of the outcome, but it must surely be better than this slow decay. Why not at least try to operate differently? Let us return to human creativity and ingenuity to propel us forward. We are explorers by nature and this pursuit is too critical to not adventure in.

What we are currently in is late stage fiat degenerate capitalism. What if there was a pure form of capitalism whereas it merely served as a stage for ideas to flourish and compete with one another? Without the pressures and incentives of profit but with the incentives of aesthetics and creation?

What if there was a way to buy more time so we as humans can focus on these ventures? What if the money we held, grew in value, and not diminished in value? Coupling this capital with the natural deflationary pressures of technological advancement could certainly propel us to a new age no? An age characterized by having more time and less things. An age characterized by incentivizing long term value creation as opposed to short term gain. Those willing to take risk and be capitalists would be able to do so without fucking someone over that chose not to take that risk.

If you go deep enough, you cease to be political because left and right become the same. Each side appealing to their respective pathos while ignoring the underlying systemic issue. Frank Zappa said it best: Politicians are the entertainment division of industry. When industry is placed in a system that incentivizes short time horizons and an inflationary spirit, industry and thereby its politicians will advocate for short term relief (either through social program spending or through less spending and less taxes).

BTC has the potential to restructure our power dynamics and greatly equalize the playing field. Will there be early winners (mostly us who ""invested"" in this)? Sure. But could this greatly benefit humanity in ways we cant even conceive of yet? Yes.

Sorry for the rambling thoughts. BTC is more than a speculative vehicle. It represents a tiny glimmer of hope in a very fucked up world",Why is this so profound?,527

When i get my salary at the end of the month, i buy the necessary amount to DCA for next month (i use binance auto-invest feature, can even start with $1 daily) then i withdraw to my wallet the sats i stacked each month.

i will never use these sats until everyone is using bitcoin as a unit of account.

&amp;#x200B;

Just an idea i wanted to share with this great community !","DCA Bitcoin, a way of life for me",0

It especially hurts me because I knew about bitcoin in 2015 when it was 200$. I had a lot of savings as a single air force lieutenant, putting most of my savings into stocks, mutual funds, and LOTS in precious metals. Bitcoin was just a side bet. I liked it because it was a non state controlled money. Rodger Ver emotionally said Bitcoin was a protest to the state and all of the children it killed in Iraq so I got a couple BTC as ""diversification"" into an alternative hard money. I had the gold/silver bug so I accumulated a lot more silver than BTC, because I had low confidence in the stock market. Knowing all of that, I just watched BTC go from 200 to 20000, to 3000 in the following years. I just watched, did nothing. ""Wow crazy, I guess I'll see what happens and hope it goes back up."" If I had the foresight, if I did the work to understand BTC, if I just had the conviction I have now, I would have put all my thousands of savings into BTC instead of precious metals. Then by know, I would have been financially free, escaped the matrix rat race, and have all the time I want, living in my dream home. Whats so painful is, I was already in camp ""End the Fed"", team ""occupy wall street"". I was primed for the orange pill, but I never took it. Now I've finally swallowed the pill and I panic sell all of my fiat to BTC as much as possible at 20K. My question is, what was the Cause. How could I have missed the opportunity that I was so ready for. Why didn't I see that BTC is superior to god/silver?",Trying to understand the cause of the effect (of not having more bitcoin),6

Here‚Äôs the thing, the stock market is made for the rich man. If you DONT HAVE THE MONEY TO LOSE, DONT INVEST. That‚Äôs what they bank on - the broke man gets scared and sells low. Well who lowers the price??? The rich man!! And guess what, he sells at the peak and buys back when you sell. That process is repeated FOREVER. 

I‚Äôm not sure where Bitcoin will go, but I promise you this, I‚Äôm never selling. This is a huge dump by the rich to lower the price, to have all their friends and banks buy low‚Ä¶ if you sell, don‚Äôt ever invest again.

With the basis hike today and the decrease in people house hunting, I think something to consider is that many people are going to put off buying a home now that were in the market.

Many of these people were looking for the 20% down, but with the rates increasing it is putting the desired home out of reach.

I do not believe it is a stretch to believe that this money will sit in the bank. I can see those who are financially concerned not buying out of that concern and they may view buying into BTC now as a good option.

Especially considering it will be years before the housing market normalizes. If somebody is going to hold onto their assets for 3-5 years, that is a more than reasonable time to see some returns in BTC.

Additionally, when all of the media is crying wolf about the economy and a recession, they're usually wrong and all the noise tends to signal the bottom.

I also imagine there will be some strong political movement on getting oil prices in check before energy demand increases in the fall (northern hemisphere).

My general rule is a week of stability in the market and no negative news the following week is one of  a few entry signals I follow.

The difference is the effective interest rate = interest rate - inflation rate.

For the moment, money was printed with practically zero interest rate. The effective interest rate is therefore negative. Your bank account balance stays the same but the loaf of bread becomes more expensive. It's the same thing when your bank account has a negative interest rate chipping away from your saving and the loaf of bread keeping the same price.

The same thing is happening with Bitcoin. The value of Bitcoin is decreasing but the number of Bitcoins in the market is the same. I need more sats to buy the bread now.

Let's not forget where the increase of Bitcoin price came from. It came from the same source where the stocks got their increase. It's the same reason. Call it stimulus check, call it money printing, ...

The price of Bitcoin got inflated the same way as everything else.

However, as a good news, this is where the difference between fiat and Bitcoin comes into play:

Governments have control over inflation and interest rate of their currency. They are tweaking the dials (maybe in their favour, maybe not).

With Bitcoin, no one controls inflation because there is none. And the interest rate will be based on the international free market. We should see interest rate for Bitcoin as effective interest rate that can also be negative. Maybe the market wants the interest rate to be negative? Who knows? And that translates to an effective inflation. But that's not the end of the world. Inflation happens! And it should happen. We can't have the good without the bad.

But, most importantly, the whole world decides if there is inflation. Not a government!

Plus, Bitcoin has the advantage to send money almost instantly to the other side of the world for practically free.","Bitcoin can have ""inflation"" without Bitcoins being minted",0

People often talk about ""intrinsic value"", but I do not think the understand what this means.  ‚ÄúIntrinsic‚Äù means to come from within.  But is it not true that all value comes from within?  Indeed a car would have no value if it were floating off in space or in a world with no road or fuel infrastructure, but if we are to ask what is the value of a car are we not asking what is the value of a car in *this* universe?   In this universe what is the value of Bitcoin?  To state this question more clearly‚Äîwhat is the utility of Bitcoin?

In order to answer that one must first understand what money is.  Many people have ideas of money but I find very few have thought deeply about it and asked the question ‚ÄúWhy is money valuable?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat is the utility of money?‚Äù  The first forms of money were tally sticks from about 25,000 years ago.  Money predates history itself and its origin corresponds with an inflection point of the advancement of human civilization.  I would argue that it is actually money that allowed human civilization to develop beyond the day to day consumption-based lives of primitive Paleolithic humans.  Money allows people to transact with each other and conduct economic activity more efficiently, but people who focus on this minor aspect of money miss the point in the same way that a two dimensional person would be limited from seeing the scope and depth of the three dimensional world around them.  The true utility of money is that it allows people to save for the future.  In a society without money there is no way to save for the future.  The is very uncertain in such a society so people must devote their efforts to focusing on the present.  But that all changed when humans invented money.  Suddenly it became possible for humans to save and with savings the future became more certain driving entire societies to shift their time preference to thinking more about the future instead of only the present.  The first monies were very primitive‚Äîthey were tally sticks, or seashells.  They had many flaws; for example, someone could go gather more seashells which would eat into the savings of people using seashells as savings.  But despite these flaws primitive monies offered tremendous utility to those who adopted them.  What is the utility of such money?  The ubiquitous adoption of across human settlements suggest that money has extremely high utility to the point of it being essential for survival of the society.

Of course seashells and tally sticks have been long replaced by better forms of money that are better suited to resist having their savings leak away due to inflation, but the leakage is still very high.  The money most people use has a leak.  We can see a clear correlation between the economic choices people in a society make and the quality of the money they use.  In a hyperinflation scenario like Venezuela, people stop thinking about the future and focus so much on the present that resources are squandered and consumed to the point of near starvation.  All capital is destroyed and there are no long term investments that are essential for a prosperous society.  In the same way, a money that has less leakage than the current most-used money would shift the time preference of people further toward the future.  The future would become more certain which would result in less consumption and more long term investment.

What is the value of such a money that allows people to save without those savings leaking away from inflation?  What is the utility such a money would offer people who use it?  The value of such a money is so high that it cannot be quantified in terms of an inferior money.  It is like asking how many seashells gold would be worth; it is a nonsensical question.   So if you are wondering if Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued, you need only check the price.  If there is one, it is massively undervalued.",What is the intrinsic value of Bitcoin? -My answer to this question,0

""The global balance sheet and net worth more than tripled between 2000 and 2020. Assets grew from $440 trillion, or about 13.2 times GDP, in 2000 to $1,540 trillion in 2020, while net worth grew from $160 trillion to $510 trillion.""

It got me thinking: With a current BTC market cap of roughly 1 trillion, this amounts to approximately 0.05% of the world's total assets + net worth (2020 numbers).

From a meta perspective, where do you see Bitcoin in the future? Do you envision bitcoin amounting to 1% of the world's total assets + net worth in say 20 years? Way more? Way less?

I started a new job and have some extra income I feel comfortable putting towards Bitcoin.

However, all the wallets and other stuff is confusing me.

*****For reference, I am in Canada, using Wealthsimple.

My question is:

If I purchase .5 Bitcoin through wealthsimple, will I be able to transfer that to a cold wallet like one of the Ledger ones for safe keeping. Then, in a few years, if the value goes up, would I be able to transfer from the wallet back to Wealthsimple and sell? To then transfer into my bank account? I am not interested in Bitcoin for the noble decentralization ideas, I just want to make money honestly (yes, I am already investing in stock and ETFs etc.)

Or am I simplifying everything too much and missing some aspects? Also, are there fees (if so how much)? 
I am having some difficulty finding info on this specific idea with wealthsimple, which is why I am testing my luck here.

* The average price of houses in California were around $300,000+.
* Two pizzas were bought with 10,000 Bitcoins.

In the present year of 2022,

* The average price of houses is around $800,000.
* A little over 1 Bitcoin (even after the massive dump, a value of $21,297 at the time of writing) can cover a minimum down payment on the average $800,000 house price.

Worst case scenarios for Bitcoin:

* If Bitcoin drops 50%, 1 Bitcoin is enough to buy a decent used car.
* If Bitcoin drops 90%, 1 Bitcoin is enough to cover the average rent in California.

Yet still on the trendline, the buying power of the USD decreases, and the buying power of Bitcoin increases.

I have never used the lightning network and honestly don't know a lot about it. Considering testing it out on CashApp since I am familiar with the app and at this point don't want to really mess with other wallets or more exchanges

1. Can I send from lightning network to any BTC Wallet? Or must it be Lightning?

Even gold is taking a beating and not behaving like the inflation hedge so admired by gold bugs like Peter Schiff.

The current uncertainty is leading to this extreme fear situation in the markets.

Rather than doing what so many others are doing by panicking and selling, look at what those who are convinced about the future of Bitcoin are doing. They HODL no matter what:

* MicroStrategy - 129,218 BTC | -30%
* Tesla - 43,200 BTC | -40%
* Block - 8,027 BTC | -23%
* El Salvador - 2,301 BTC | -55%
* ...

The examples are legion and all these market players know that the only thing to do in this market phase is to HODL Bitcoin no matter what. Accumulate more BTC if you can. Otherwise, stay away from the markets. You're not in this market for the short term since you've figured out the why of Bitcoin.

So let the traders argue with each other and those who don't believe in Bitcoin lose money. In the meantime, take some time to focus on things that matter to you.

Eventually, the market will turn around, and Bitcoin will emerge the winner as it always has since its inception. Patience is the key as always with Bitcoin.","While some panic, others continue to be Bitcoin HODLers no matter what: MicroStrategy, Tesla, Block, El Salvador, ...",8

* The meeting is set to take place at 11 a.m. Frankfurt time

*Carolynn Look*

&gt;The European Central Bank‚Äôs Governing Council will hold an unscheduled meeting to discuss the recent selloff in government bonds, which has grown in intensity after plans were announced to begin raising interest rates from record lows.  
The rate-setting panel will convene on Wednesday ‚Äúto discuss current market conditions,‚Äù according to an ECB spokesperson. The meeting will begin at 11am Frankfurt time, a person familiar with the matter said. A statement may follow.  
The announcement comes after the yield on Italy‚Äôs 10-year debt rose above 4% for the first time since 2014 this week. Investors are so far unconvinced the ECB can raise borrowing costs to combat unprecedented euro-zone inflation while also keeping yields among the bloc‚Äôs most vulnerable members in check.  
A possible 75 basis-point rate increase from the Federal Reserve later in the day could add to the jitters.  
Italian yields fell back as much as 29 basis points to 3.89% at Wednesday‚Äôs open, while the euro rose as much as 0.6% to 1.0475 against the dollar and money markets pared bets on a half-point rate hike next month to 50%.  
‚ÄúThe central bank needs to be concerned if investors cannot buy or sell bonds in secondary markets and issuers have to postpone funding,‚Äù said Christoph Rieger, head of fixed-rate strategy at Commerzbank. ‚ÄúIn contrast to earlier episodes of disorderly market movements, however, inflation makes the difference this time around. The ECB cannot simply pour money at the problem as monetary tightening and higher rates are actually needed.‚Äù  
While government bonds have been jumpy for some time, the ECB has so far only allocated reinvestments from its pandemic asset-purchase program toward stabilizing what it considers unwarranted market turbulence.  
Investors, meanwhile, have been on the lookout for an additional instrument to tackle so-called fragmentation, and there was some disappointment when officials didn‚Äôt unveil one at their policy meeting last week.  
‚ÄòNo Limits‚ÄôWhile the Governing Council says it can quickly devise a new tool, it‚Äôs been reluctant to reveal details, convinced that there are few benefits in doing so and worried the markets may immediately try to test its limits.  
Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel -- who‚Äôs in charge of the ECB‚Äôs market operations -- signaled Tuesday evening that any response to bond-market panic will come when it‚Äôs needed and will depend on the specific situation officials are faced with.  
She did, however, pledge that the ECB won‚Äôt tolerate ‚Äúchanges in financing conditions that go beyond fundamental factors and that threaten monetary-policy transmission,‚Äù saying the commitment to stave off fragmentation ‚Äúhas no limits.‚Äù  
Those remarks drew parallels to former ECB President Mario Draghi‚Äôs famous 2012 promise to do ‚Äúwhatever it takes‚Äù to save the euro. Schnabel highlighted the ECB‚Äôs Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program and the OMT created under Draghi as examples of policy makers‚Äô ability to respond to different kinds of market stress.  
The bond storm comes with the ECB poised to end eight years of negative rates with a ‚Äúsustained‚Äù cycle of hikes planned from July and including a likely half-point move in September. It plans to end net purchases under a long-standing bond-buying program at the start of next month.  
Several Governing Council members were due to speak on Wednesday. Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel‚Äôs remarks at 11:15 a.m. in Milan have been cancelled, as have Bank of Spain chief Pablo Hernandez de Cos‚Äôs at 2:30 p.m.  
Wednesday‚Äôs ad hoc meeting was first reported by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.

I am trying to have a go at using Eclair Lightning with Bitcoin Core.

I have managed, after a lot of messing about with .conf files, to get somewhere.  Reading all the 'How-to's' around, I am supposed to see some kind of GUI after configuring the .conf files, although I don't see anything.  Using CMTrace to read the log files, everything seems ok (log files can be supplied if someone could take a look).

This is my process:

Firstly, I run Bitcoin Core.  That has a fully-downloaded transaction log.  Then, I assume that I need run the 'eclair-node.bat' file to get Eclair to run? The 'Eclair.log' file populates but just sits there.

Here is a tiny snippet of the log:

Am I going about  this all wrong or is it just a case of waiting for something to happen?

&amp;#x200B;

There will still be some hobbyists that will run their nodes because they like doing so. Bless them. :)

Mining difficulty shall adjust and some miners will still operate, I guess.

(I just learned about the bitcoin mining death spiral [https://bitcoinchaser.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-death-spiral](https://bitcoinchaser.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-death-spiral). According to the article it's still a theoretical possibility, even though never happened)

&amp;#x200B;

As long as there at least a few nodes+miners, we still have a network.

The network will still offer borderless censorship free payments. Some people will use it.

The significantly smaller network can be more vulnerable to 51% attacks. But still bitcoin's game theory motivates such possible attackers to join the network (=more profitable). In any case, even if double spends occur, the network still carries value.

If this goes on for a long time, and more and more bitcoin hardcore fans abandon the network, it could really die out. It's possible, I guess.

My apologies for not giving more material to work with here, I had wanted to summarize the entire chapter but it just wasn't happening this week.  Specifically, this is the central point of a portion of Part 4: Time and Risk, Chapter 13: Investment.

&amp;#x200B;

Financial institutions enable people who will never meet to cooperate and pool their resources for investments.  In 2009, financial institutions held $60 trillion in international investments.  These investments do not come from small groups of wealthy individuals, but by aggregating the contributions (IRAs, bank accounts, etc.) of millions of people.  Countries without these large financial institutions are not capable of connecting borrowers to lenders at such scale or with such efficiency so as to enable modern society.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I thought this section was interesting; the basic implication is that for modern society to flourish, large financial institutions need to rely on the contributions of millions of lenders to pool their money for investments.  This would of course be against the bitcoiner ethos of ""not your keys not your coin""; Sowell is unlikely to be mistaken in asserting this as a requirement for modern society, so something must give.  The basic impulse to believe we will find a cryptographic workaround that allows for trustless lending has yet to bear fruit, and on several levels I am skeptical its even possible.  So we are left with the proposition that risk will have to be entertained for bitcoin to succeed as a currency; at some point exchanges will need to be trusted to lend their bitcoin to entrepreneurs, and I don't think that could ever be ""fully collateralized"".  What do you guys think?",Reading club week 2: Thomas Sowell on investment,3

So many comments on these subs at the end of 2021 and early '22 from so many people wishing they had got in at a lower price. Well here is your opportunity.

You'll see many comments such as 'Don't catch a falling knife', or 'It's still dropping, and could drop to $10k or $5k, so wait until then', 'Don't be a fool buying now', 'Take your losses and run', 'Come back in later', etc. However, purchase small amounts often (or stack free satoshis from sites now offering more as the price drops), ignore the noise &amp; FUD, and stick to your **long term** plan.

Will you regret buying small amounts often in 10 or 20 years time when you look back to this year and see how many sats you stashed up?

* If Bitcoin goes to zero, it's not the end of the world and shouldn't be the end of your investments (diversify), and don't invest money you can't afford to lose.
* If Bitcoin goes to $100k, $500k, or more in the next 10 years, you won't regret it, and obtaining one bitcoin/BTC will become only obtainable by millionaires.

Remember most of us didn't get in early, but that doesn't necessarily mean you have missed out.

This is why buying Bitcoin after a crash has always been profitable and always will be.

They stay in until they can't take the pain anymore and sell at any price.

They breathe a sigh of relief as the price goes down more.

Today I thought about ten basic things I have learned in this time and want to share with this community that has helped me with a lot of info.  


With no revision and in a foreign language for the, this are the thoughts right out of my hat... here we go. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) **Education**: Faith based on principles. 

\- Do your **HOMEWORK**. Get to know BTC. It is NOT neccesary to be a programmer and understand code. Learn about the idea, principles and fundaments. Avoid influencers. 

\- You HAVE TO **READ** *The Bitcoin standard*. What is money? Why is something valuable? Why is bitcoin neccesary for humanity? This will OPEN YOUR EYES (like matrix style)

&amp;#x200B;

2) **Self-custody**: Take control of what is yours. 

\- ***Not your keys, not your coins***. This CAN'T BE SAID ENOUGH. Recent case of Celcius halting withdrawals is a new clear example. Big exchanges closing WILL happen again. 

\- Get a **HARDWARE WALLET** and NEVER type your seed phrase into ANY other device than a hardware wallet. Stamp your seed on titanium or stainless steel and secure it.

&amp;#x200B;

3) **FIAT management**: Working is minning for FIAT.  

\- DO NOT INVEST MONEY THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE (or that you are willing to lose). In other words: Do not invest money that you might need in the short term. 

\- Do not let SENTIMENTS or media guide you. Investing is generally a long-term game. Avoid driving your decitions by FUD or FOMO. DCA is a good aproach for most ppl.

&amp;#x200B;

4) **Mining**: Not as your primary job. 

\- If you want to get into minning BTC or altcoins, take in consideration that the **ROI** that you estimate is just WRONG. Do not depend on this money in any way. 

\- Take neccessary electrical precautions. Low gauge wires, bad boards, faulty risers or PSUs are a **FIRE HAZARD** and you can lose your house, family, etc. Be safe!

&amp;#x200B;

5) **Discretion**: Satoshi set the example. 

\- Do not spread the word about you owning bitcoin. You can talk about it with friends that have interest in BTC, but **NEVER DISCLOSE** publicly or privately your stack. 

\- Remember BTC is pseudonimous, but not anonimous. Take this into account when making transactions, because others will be able to look at an adress balance. 

&amp;#x200B;

6) **Trading**: Playing lottery, losing gold. 

\- **There is no CRYPTO, just BITCOIN. There are no ALTCOINS, just SHITCOINS.** Don't trade the most valuable asset for shiny shitcoins. Also avoid leverage, futures, etc.

\- Consider trading as **GAMBLING**. If you are ok with going to the casino and losing, you can trade your BTC. You do can win, but the odds are you going down hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

7) **Preaching**: Bitcoin doesn't needs you; you need it. 

\- Do not try to CONVINCE family, friends or others about getting into bitcoin. It can be harmful and lead to jealousy (for your stack), fear, greed, anger, etc. 

\- If you are in a serious relationship, talk to your partnet about BTC investing. Be both ok with it, the risks, the benefits, the patience. Be both at peace. 

&amp;#x200B;

8) **Bears and bulls**: A rollercoaster ride. 

\- **DO NOT open many times a day price charts**. Forget the candles too. Zoom out into the past, and into the future with faith. BTC value is still innimaginable. 

\- **Buy when there's BLOOD IN THE STREETS, even if the blood is YOUR OWN**. You can look at the FEAR AND GREED. As said before, don't let emotions guide your moves.

&amp;#x200B;

9) **Acumulation**: Stack those sats!

\- It is good to have **GOALS**. But also enjoy the small steps in the way. A thousand miles journey begins with a single step. Just keep stacking what you can!

\- **GREED** might be a powerfull tool for incentivation, or can be a strong demise. Having 0,001 BTC or 1 BTC have both a lot of value if it reflects your effort.  

&amp;#x200B;

10) **To the moon**: A different destination to all

\- Some people have the intention to stack and **HODL** for their children to inherit the coins. HODLing is a different time frame for everyone. Just forget about time if possible. 

\- Set **YOUR OWN MOON**. Every moon is valid. It might be a new car (*Lambo*!), an overseas family vacation, a new guitar, etc. To me, my family house will be my moon.

&amp;#x200B;

And for the last but maybe most important thing... HODL !!! Cash out all you need for an emergency health or life or death situation, but otherwise, **FFS HODL** !!!

&amp;#x200B;

Never thought about it much, but looking back, there has definitely been stages of the internet, and the transitions were almost seamless, maybe because I can still remember life before the internet.  So to sit there on Napster using 56k for 3-5 hours waiting for my favorite song to download was still an awesome experience, and everything offered after that has been happily used.  All that to ask, what or how would a decentralized internet even look like?  I would imagine it would be like TOR browser, but it‚Äôs hard to picture using the internet without using Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.  But I think people are really starting to reject how monetized these browsers and platforms have become, it reminds me of the old days and pop-ups, except now this shit is listening to you to get you the right advertisements.  It would also seem that Big Tech isn‚Äôt really pushing for the adoption of decentralization.  What are your thoughts?  Are we about to witness WWWI (world wide web) war?  Or will monetization and decentralized be able to co-exist on Big Tech servers without them data collecting every move you make on a decentralized ecosystem?  A lot of these ‚Äúdecentralized sites‚Äù are still requiring email with login‚Äôs‚Ä¶",Tech question from a Non-Tech Guy,0

That said, I get confused about some bitcoiner snark and sentiment surrounding the market when people hit the exits.

Some express derision and angst toward those who are scared, selling, or faltering with a ‚ÄúThanks for selling us cheap Bitcoin, we never needed you and never will‚Äù attitude. (I understand that attitude and like BTC on sale, too.)

Some of you have put up with bad attitudes or misunderstanding from friends and family for years. (Insert exhausted Saylor exhale‚Ä¶) So maybe it‚Äôs just a defense mechanism.

But here is my question:

Doesn‚Äôt Bitcoin need and benefit from a larger market beyond the OG hoddlers?

The larger the market of buyers/sellers the more demand, greater adoption rate, and increased value‚Ä¶correct?

If so, why do some Bitcoiners combine the ideas that Bitcoin WILL have a large market (it‚Äôs inevitable) but then laugh when market participants run away scared, suggesting that no market is actually needed to accomplish this inevitability? 

I realize there is built in scarcity with capped supply and halving, but I don‚Äôt understand the idea of ‚Äúgo away market, BTC doesn‚Äôt need you anyway.‚Äù 

When the market shrinks so does the price, which of course benefits and consolidates BTC in stronger (more deserving) hands. 

However, doesn‚Äôt BTC benefit from ‚Äúmore hands‚Äù by way of wider adoption rates and hands learning to be stronger? 

Perhaps the idea is that the base shrinks every winter, yet is always larger than it was the time before‚Ä¶so the overall market is actually growing regardless of those who fold?

I‚Äôm asking because I care about understanding this sentiment and because it sounds strange to me when bitcoiners chase away and scoff at weak hands‚Ä¶even while desiring larger adoption rates (demand.)

This little increase in interest rates is the main factor causing this crash.

The system is extremely leveraged, sensitive, and dependent on continuously increasing money supply.

This seems like a sign that the fiat ponzi is nearing a point of almost dying. The Fed will eventually lower rates again and turn up the money printer because the system depends on it.

Seems like ever more reason why we need a parallel system to act as a life boat for us to transition to :)",Signs That Fiat Is Dying,1

Long story short, I‚Äôve been contemplating two gameplans:

1. Simply put a bit of my paycheck into BTC, whatever price, what I can afford, and go from there (safe)

2. If the price drops under $20k per BTC, Seek either 5:1 or 10:1 leverage position to purchase BTC, with an initial $12k collateral (risky, plus it‚Äôs not legal here in US, so I‚Äôd have to open account through someone offshore)

If they continue on this path the stock market and real estate market will next see a bloodbath waterfall that we've seen in bitcoin. They know this and it is why they were slowly raising rates by 0.25% at a time.

The fact they started to exponentially raise rates at doubling speed 0.25 0.50 .75 is a manipulation tatic to make people think ""omg its getting worse i better sell everything now and hold dollars."" The 10 year treasury is acting similar to a penny stock it starts going up parabolic you know its gonna crash. These rate hikes are transitory. 

The fed can not raise rates for a long time at this speed. The mortgage backed securities market has already flashed NO BID. There's a reason they bailout in 2008 and 2020. You are drunk if you think they're wont be more bailouts, but **its more likely they will reverse course before we even need a bailout**, because the bailout would put us on a even faster path to hyperinflation.

Those who laughed as us this week, will be asking for our help soon enough. Help them, teach them how to hold their own keys.

The past couple of days the Bitcoin network has been particularly busy.

https://puu.sh/J5Pvj/afd7b7797a.png

Block after block is full to the brim. We can look at the transaction fees miners have been receiving from these full blocks:

$5,333

$2,791

$7,360

$4,599

$7,558

$3,721

$4,077

$5,026

These are nice, but it's an absolute pittance compared to the subsidy reward, which is currently about 6.5 BTC = $140,000,

As we all know this subsidy reward will trail to zero over time and the network will have to secure itself on transaction fees alone. But how is this to happen? The last couple of days we've seen what full blocks look like. It doesn't matter if the network gets more popular, the blocks are already full. Fees are going to have to at least 10x and that is being extremely generous, even then the reward would still be less than it is now. Realistically fees will need to 30x.

How can the transaction fees increase in any meaningful degree?

It must mean the base layer is practically NEVER used by random joes like you and me. The only movement on the base layer will have to come from:

- large bundles of transactions being done on lightning and settled on the base layer.

- nations &amp; corporate entities moving hundreds of millions or billions of dollars worth around.

These are the only two ways I can think of. If the base layer is still being used by the average guy, that MUST mean transaction fees are low, which MUST mean the miners are receiving very low rewards. Even if it's used by more people it doesn't matter, if regular people are willing to operate on the base layer then Bitcoin will fail.

edit: the 20 years in the title can be quibbled over but the overall point remains.",If regular people are still using the base layer in 20 years time then Bitcoin will fail.,0

With each Bitcoin cycle, the upside continues to diminish. From its previous cycle high, Bitcoin only increased 3.5x from 2017 to 2021, whereas it increased 20x from the cycle high in 2013 to 2017, and even more than that obviously from inception to 2013. But the problem is that it still drops \~85% with each cycle, so the upside return diminishes, but the downside risk remains.

To me, this suggests that unless Bitcoin actually accomplishes one of its use cases/adoption arguments, then it actually will end up having no value at all. I know that sounds obvious, but it isn't a point that I often see made around here. Bitcoin is actually just as risky as it was in 2009, it just isn't as profitable, and the only thing that is going to alter that, is widespread adoption. In other words, its value as a speculative asset is actually running out.

This cycle has shown, and perhaps will show, that a lot of the myths around Bitcoin are not true, even if one day they will be. Institutional adoption, whales, the amount of money in it, none of that has made any real difference when the chips were down. It hasn't proven itself as having any direct relationship with inflation (it just goes up a lot more than inflation does in general, like stocks), it has stored value over long periods of time so far, it isn't digital gold, it is sort of a currency in some places but not really, and it is no longer uncorrelated with stocks (part of the inevitable progression of an asset becoming more widespread). While some of this can be attributed to the macro conditions surrounding us, assets are always presumed to exist in those conditions, not in a vacuum. And no, Bitcoin hasn't been through a recession yet, but it is at risk of going below its previous ATH, and maybe even leaving 4-year holders in the red, two things that haven't happened yet.

I'm sure most investors know Bitcoin is risky, but as I said, I don't often see it pointed out as to why it is risky. It isn't just the speculative aspect of it, it is the fact that it takes more and more money to move the price up consistently, and absent a use case, and considering the enormous and varied opposition to it, Bitcoin either has to become widespread or die, and investors shouldn't expect prices to go up consistently every 4 years because of some technical feature (the halvening). You can look at Bitcoin anyway that you want to, but I'd urge investors to look at it not as a financial gamble, but how plausible they think it really is that Bitcoin will become widely adopted, and if you don't think it will, consider seriously why you are investing in it.","If Bitcoin doesn't see widespread adoption, it is going to 0, right?",5

2. Is it possible to connect/use another entities node (not payment channel) to access and use the LN?

If its the case that everyone who seeks to use the LN has to run their own node, I see various problems for mass adoption. However if its possible to use another persons node I see how this can be scaled and easy to use.

Maybe this might help somebody within these difficult times.

Let's start with the following disclosure: I focused my investment in 3 crypto project, with BTC being the biggest bag and I am in red in all of them.
This begs the question: is my hodl and dca mentality wrong? With stop loses and simple TA sell/buy orders I could have avoided all of this. Although this thought is true at the current moment in time, it ignores two factors: my personal necessary effort and the non-deterministic nature of the markt (including BTC). Let's start with the former: I spent quite some time understanding BTC and Crypto in general, I still do read and learn about it every day and I would say I do understand it. However, I am no professional trader nor do I have the time and willpower to perfectly understand and time the market. Therefore, all my attempts in smartly timed sell/buy orders, would simply be blind guesses. I simply lack the time to master it and therefore I stick to the simpler approach: regular DCA and hodle. Occasionally this won't be the best approach, but in regards to my effort and time, it is. Hence, I don't doubt myself for not selling at 35k.
This brings us to the latter: the non-deterministic nature of the market. What currently happens in the world nobody could have seen coming, some might have guessed it, but it would have been one guess of many. We simply can't predict the future and therefore we should adapt our investing strategy to trends and not events. In my case, seeing a long term downtrend, I started to DCA in smaller chunks, putting some cash aside for even bigger crashes. I adapted to the trend of the market, not to possible events.Crypto is a roller coaster and hence the hodl mentality was born, as simple 10% swings, which are huge in stocks, are nothing in crypto. However, this does not mean holding until everything goes to ashes. It means, if your believe in a volatile asset is strong,temporary rough times will not destroy you. Especially not if your time horizon for your investment is 5+ years.
My believe in the fundamentals of my top 3 is big enough to continue chilling, even though times are truly rough. I hope yours is too. Stay safe!",Questioning DCA and Hodle Mentality?,0

I first heard about bitcoin in 2017, got obsessed around October and started to buy every month ever since. I basically wanted as much bitcoin as possible but didn't have too much savings so I started to DCA or go all in on a monthly basis (however you wanna interpret it). After stacking for more than one year continuously I was sitting in negative gains during the early 2019 bear market. Didn't feel quite successful. Kept stacking on a monthly basis and a year later comes the 2020 March crash which again took me under water regarding my cost basis and gains. Didn't feel too successful. Kept stacking nevertheless and right now even after all these crashes I don't feel too bad and actually welcome the opportunity to stack more sats.

It always feels bad at the time of the crash but these are times you look back years from now and are either happy that you seized the day or feel sorry because you lost confidence to buy more bitcoin.

Personally, gonna buy every month until I can retire. I document my journey here, enjoy!

Reading how the mere thought of the Fed raising interest rates have markets crumbling, it just makes you think, who in their right mind would ever think this whole thing is a good idea? I understand that no one ever voted for this system, and it was really a giant scam going all the way back to WW1, the creature from Jekyll island etc. But what is the excuse to not see through the bullshit now? I know there are thousands of Keynesian economists spouting bullshit through the standard channels, but can't people think for the themselves? Even if I didn't understand economics it would take me 10 minutes to realise this whole thing makes absolutely zero sense.

I really needed to get this off my chest. I feel like we are living in a giant hoax, and only a few people see through it.

It's it paaainfully obvious, logical, rational and so forth that you cannot 'control' a giant economy? When reading economic text books it's written as a given that the centrally planned economy of the Soviet Union was bound to fail, since you can't plan production, prices etc.

Well it's it equally obvious that you can't try to control the economy by lowering and raising interest rates, quantitative easing, and money printing?

Sorry for the rant but I'm getting to a boiling point with how this brainwashing is hurting people.

It was originally invented as a decentralized currency, meaning that it's not tied to and controlled by any governments, becoming a currency of people instead of institutions.

But after seeing the price soared, retail investors started to adopt it for its speculative characteristic, they think they can pump then dump, so their main goal is to get more fiat. 

So when they see that Bitcoin isn't doing what they wanted (raise in price compared to fiat) they sell. And the chain reaction making the price go lower and lower. 
But whatever the price is, the original purpose of Bitcoin is still intact, it is still a decentralized currency, it is still a currency of people, it's just not what retail investors wants it to be, a fiat generating machine.

So, do you think if Bitcoin price is let's say, only increase in price exactly as the US Dollar inflation rate, making it be the ultimate hedge against the US Dollar inflation, but losing its speculative trait and its potential to soar more in price, do you think people or you, will still invest in it?
Is it what happening now? Newcomers disappointed to learn that Bitcoin is not a fiat generating machine so they're dumping it?","If Bitcoin price is less volatile and less speculative, will retail investors still invest in it?",1

If your plan is to hold Bitcoin, get it off any exchange or website NOW. Don‚Äôt leave it on Coinbase, Wirex, Robinhood, Celsius, Nexo etc.

Earning interest? Doesn‚Äôt matter, the risks at present might just outweigh the benefits.

Your balance on those sites is just a promise until you actually have the Bitcoin, and in times of severe volatility your promise may be frozen or lost if or when they collapse or claim to ‚Äòget hacked‚Äô.

Most of Bitcoin is held by whales.  A huge percentage.  These whales are likely very leveraged and not at all interested in the technology.  They don't care if bitcoin ever gains full adoption.

Now, this is why I believe it would be in everyone's interest to crash bitcoin.   If you sell now and enough of you, the price will crash and all the whales will scramble and sell off to get out.   You can then buy back into the technology after all those coins have been further distributed and likely has a much better chance of seeing wide use.

Let's say that bitcoin dropped to $100 a coin.  Sounds tragic but it isn't.  You now have a mined blockchained token that cannot be mined at that price by any competing crypo currency.   You have something that cannot be recreated for what it is valued.  It is kind of like buying new equipment to start a business or buying equipment from company going out of business at pennies on the dollar.  You could also take these coupons and incorporate them I suppose into something else but there will be no way they could ever be created at a similar price point.  The price to secure these tokens would have been paid for by mostly the whales.  Instead of just being dumb dumbs who get ripped off by exchanges and whales,  you could liberate the technology to actual be used at their expense.

(1) NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR BITCOIN

(2) There is only one Bitcoin, everything else is a fad, a gambling game. If you are on the BTC network and have your own keys, you've lost **0** of your coins to exit scams or rug pulls. And you have had effectively **0** minutes of network downtime or outages or ""stuck transactions""

Where we go in the future and when we get there is anyone's guess. Do people make the right move and decide to exit all other gambles and shitcoins in favor of holding their own keys for BTC? Probably not.

Do governments move in and protect their people from Bitcoin by making it illegal? Maybe.

But in the long run, those of us with our own keys still have our BTC balance intact. And I just did two transactions today which went just fine.

In the long run, this experience, this crash, this winter will just (re) teach people the hard lessons. We'll be here again someday.","Of course, the current situation is not ""good""",0

This is the transfer of coins from weak hands looking to turn a quick buck to diamond handed hodlers. We may not ever get an opportunity like this again. Easy way to lower your average buy-in price if you just got involved over the past year or so.
2. Stop trying to earn yield on risky lending platforms. If you had funds on Celsius, I'm sorry -- it's never too late to start over. For those of you considering it and not understanding what it is, someone locks your bitcoin using their private keys so you have no access to it. Then they invest it in risky bullshit like LUNA that promises very high yields and lend it out to people who short Bitcoin. When their risky investments come back and bite them in the ass, what do they do? They shut down withdrawals and you lose your assets. Bad for Bitcoin, bad for you. Don't do it.
3. Get your coins off of exchanges. Do you like looking at that stack you've been relentlessly building on Coinbase or whatever other exchange you use? That's great, but that number is a number in a database. It's not the amount of bitcoin locked up in a special cold storage account just for you so it's always there and it's always safe. Can these exchanges handle a run and facilitate everybody's withdrawals? Who knows?!?! How would you like to find out? Through another Celsius level event??? GET YOUR COINS OFF EXCHANGES AND INTO YOUR OWN SELF-SOVEREIGN WALLET.
4. Don't participate in the shitcoin casinos. What do I mean? Don't try to make huge quick gains from alts with the intention of switching to Bitcoin. You can't time the market and if you can, it's sheer luck. You have no idea when you're going to wake up and find that your AssCoin went to zero.
5. Let me take #4 a step further. Stop supporting exchanges that offer all these shitcoins. They don't care about you, they care about taking your money. Stick to real, true, dedicated, Bitcoin-only exchanges and brokerages. Want the lowest possible fees?? Use Strike. Want the best possible customer service? Use River Financial. Want something in between those two? Use Swan Bitcoin. But for the love of god stop supporting these mega companies that offer all the latest and greatest BS that they themselves don't believe in, but are more than happy to market to you. Support Bitcoin!

My recommendations to protect yourself:

1. Get a solid, bitcoin-only wallet. ColdCard is the king of the hill. Others like BitBox02 or the new Blockstream offerings are great too, but ColdCard is proven and trusted. They have opensource firmware (unlike most hardware wallet providers like Ledger and Trezor), use a secure element (unlike Trezor), and their focus is Bitcoin Only. ColdCard lets you sign transactions on an SD card so you never ever have to plug your wallet into your computer. Your private keys stay in complete isolation. [https://store.coinkite.com/store/coldcard](https://store.coinkite.com/store/coldcard)
2. Use a good open source wallet like Sparrow or Electrum. This can even help you understand Bitcoin transactions better. They show you your list of UTXOs, your list of addresses, you can label your transactions, you get to see how the tx is assembled, visualize the inputs and outputs, step you through building the tx and signing it... you feel much closer to the network when using these apps vs something like Ledger Live. [https://sparrowwallet.com/](https://sparrowwallet.com/)
3. Run a node!!! When you have a Ledger wallet, you are connecting to Ledger's servers and requesting all the info about all of your transactions. Congrats -- Ledger know now every move you've ever made on the blockchain. Using Sparrow wallet? You're still connecting to some external node to broadcast your transactions and get blockchain data. You can easily and cheaply run your own node, which puts your voice, your vote onto the network about what Bitcoin rules should be enforced, and your wallet can connect directly to it for all its operational needs. Never again will you be transmitting your tx data across the internet or trusting that some external node is providing you the right answers. I highly recommend raspiblitz: [https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz)
4. Finally, deeply research seed phrase security. Find out what works for you. At a bare minimum, use some sort of steel plate that is resistant to fire, corrosion, etc. Multisig, XOR, etc are all great but add complexities to recovering your seedphrase. There is a trade off with enhanced security -- make sure your loved ones know how all of this works in the event something happens to you. At a minimum, I recommend using a passphrase.

MicroStrategy [holds ‚Çø129,218](https://bitcointreasuries.net/) worth around $3 billion (today) The only loan obtained on this large holding is a [mere $205 million](https://coinfomania.com/microstrategy-subsidiary-205m-loan-bitcoin/).

MicroStrategy used $805M in BTC collateral to obtain the loan. It is this position that comes at risk if the price goes to $21,000 per $MSTR CFO.

However, $MSTR still holds a lot more BTC and can still post more collateral from the rest of its BTC. For clarity., they still have over 100,000 BTC to post as collateral.

As Saylor has clarified, the company can [keep posting more collateral](https://coinfomania.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-margin-call-3652/) until Bitcoin **drops as low as $3562!**

I want to remind anyone still in doubt,  that while bitcoin is an amazing tool and asset, it is not a ""get rich quick"" magic pill. You still need to be careful, you still need to be smart. 

This is where the saying ""don't invest more than you can afford to lose"" comes from. These events happen fast, and you need to be realistic with yourself and not get high on the hopium that your purchase will 10000x like early investors.

Right now I have BTC split between cold storage, DeFi interest accounts, and as collateral for a $40,000 bitcoin-backed USD loan through Celsius (ouch, I know) which I used to finance mining equipment early this year. I'm not an expert by any means, but I am *extremely* long on bitcoin, and will continue to be. I am a HODLer, a speculator, and consider myself an advocate for BTC adoption. That being said:

The whole point of Bitcoin is returning now-centralized monetary policy to the decentralized hands of the people - in doing so, being your own bank. Part of being your own bank is control of lending out held assets for reasonable interest returns.

Bitcoin having that inherent utility is something that makes it viable and relevant on a world financial stage. If we can't build the trust and the viability for bitcoin to satisfy **all** **aspects** of which traditional fiat is capable, including interest-based loans, then why should the price continue to rise? Why should more people adopt it? If it doesn't have the utility, then it makes sense that the price would drop to reflect the loss in faith as a financial engine and rise in perception only as a tool for speculation and a volatile store of value.

We need to be able to face these setbacks, persevere, and try again. Participating in DeFi for me wasn't about getting rich quick. Part of it was turning held assets into a source of passive income, and the other part, about being willing to take the risk to move Bitcoin toward the mainstream by demonstrating that it has the capability to be utilized as a true financial asset. That it can do *something* other than sit in cold storage doing *nothing*. I both loaned BTC and borrowed against it. I used BTC gains to pay for a down payment on a house. How many can really say they've used BTC for meaningful change in their life?

It's safe and easy to sit back and HODL and point at the risks. *Not your keys, not your coins* is true. It's also a motto of distrust in a system that, ultimately requires some measure of trust to function as a collective resource. It's the people taking the risks, the people who buy and sell with Bitcoin, or start businesses with it, that overall both determine and demonstrate its value. Handing over BTC to borrowers is risky, and no one should loan out more than they can afford to lose, especially through a centralized intermediary. But being a pioneer isn't about sitting back and being safe 100% of the time. 

DeFi lending operations weren't ever perfect on paper, and I participated (both to lend and to borrow) full knowing the risks. I did so because I knew that it didn't just need to work in fair weather, but that someone had to be willing to winter the storms, as well if BTC is to persevere. Now I stand to take a loss (though not a ruinous one, because I never risked more than I could afford to lose), and I'm at peace with that. If the majority of this initial generation's DeFi institutions fail, it's still a learning experience. It's tools we need to make the next generation safer and more effective, hopefully with more ability to manage the lean times. And if any survive, it shows us the frameworks we need moving forward to be safer and more transparent with future iterations of DeFi.

I'll still be fine if Celsius liquidates my loan collateral to void the loan (which should happen if BTC drops to \~$14k and I don't put up additional collateral). I'll be fine if the assets I've got in DeFi lending accounts is lost. I don't need a government bailout to socialize my losses while privatizing my gains. That's what *risk* is. I've had both gains and losses. I'll continue to both mine and buy BTC. And I'll be willing to try again.

Because eventually, we have to take some risks to prove BTC can overcome these growing pains. I'm still interested in DeFi. I'm interested in using my earned assets to generate passive income via collateralized loans the same as I am in using my earned assets to generate passive income via purchasing mining equipment. If Bitcoin can't work *for* me, then it has no value to me other than its $USD conversion. If no one takes the risks, then the ecosystem and use cases don't grow. And if the use cases don't grow, why should anyone who wants to be able to *use* money, not just stash it under their mattress, buy into the idea of Bitcoin? 

Damn, this ended up being long. DMs are disabled for today.

TL:DR: This is good for Bitcoin. Bitcoin needs use cases in order to grow, and not all of those use cases will be immediately successful. Bitcoin businesses need to be able to weather lean times to prove they're worth using in the good times. And when/if they fail, we need to try again better with everything we learned. There is no growth without risk.",Alternate view on DeFi collapse and the current situation,10

**Author: Ethan Lou (Special to The Globe and Mail), published 2022-06-12**

So, is bitcoin dead?

From a peak in November, 2021, of nearly US$70,000 for one unit, bitcoin‚Äôs value has been cut by more than half to about US$30,000 currently. The broader cryptocurrency market has similarly tanked.

Well, the answer to that question is that bitcoin dies often. It has fallen by 50 per cent or more at least seven other times.

Whether you like bitcoin or hate it, its fundamental qualities haven‚Äôt changed, and there‚Äôs no point in rehashing them. But in terms of price, chances are, like all the other times bitcoin died, like all the other times the stock market or oil crashed, this won‚Äôt be the last time the cryptocurrency dies ‚Äì it will live again to die another day.

For the investor who believes in the fundamentals but in 2021 thought, ‚Äúbitcoin is so high right now ‚Äì I missed the boat,‚Äù now might be the time to revisit that idea. While this may or may not be a bottom for bitcoin prices, a lot of people sure are seeing buying opportunities.

The Canadian exchange Bitbuy tells me its data show heavy crypto buying during the recent turmoil. Usually, it‚Äôs about 50-50, but at one point in May, buy orders (not necessarily filled) on Bitbuy outstripped sell orders with a 65:35 ratio. (According to crypto price-tracking website CoinMarketCap, considered a reputable source for such numbers, total 24-hour trading volume is about $1.6-million.)

Investors have also been piling into crypto exchange-traded funds. And long-term bitcoin holders have been adding to their stacks, blockchain data show.

To be sure, this idea of buying the dip involves both going against the grain and a bit of behavioural psychology. To catch the price bottom before the rebound, you have to be buying when everyone else is full of foreboding and woe. Certainly, parts of the mainstream finance world are looking like that, amid rising interest rates and the pullback on risk assets. But, in crypto, if there are so many people still buying, then the buying-the-dip logic would imply that right now is probably not the time to enter.

Taking a wider look at the crypto markets, the answer is the same. As I‚Äôve written before in The Globe, a good indicator of bitcoin prices is the so-called ‚Äúhalving,‚Äù a reduction of the rate at which new bitcoins are introduced into the system. And it‚Äôs not exactly flashing a big buy signal.

Every four years, the rate at which new bitcoins are created gets cut in half. When that happens, it‚Äôs a big blow to supply. About a year or so after each halving, bitcoin would rally to some unprecedented price and lift the wide crypto market ‚Äì probably by too much, with hype overtaking fundamentals ‚Äì and then prices start to fall. A year or so before the next halving, bitcoin reaches a bottom. And then the cycle repeats.

The next halving is set to happen at around March of 2024. Going by the halvings theory, that would mean that bitcoin would bottom out sometime late 2022, maybe even early 2023 ‚Äì approaching, but not here yet.

The caveat to all of that: Even with all the indicators and calculations in the world, there is a lot about the markets we simply don‚Äôt know, especially for crypto, which has only been around for 13 years.

It is a good idea to keep in mind the general ideas of identifying buying opportunities and going against the grain, and the market cycles of crypto. But as with any asset, timing the market to precision, buying low and selling high, is not easy and a failed attempt often leaves retail investors badly burned.

Perhaps the answer as to whether now is a buying opportunity is to go at it more gingerly, in the way of the old dollar-cost-averaging tactic. That is, if you think bitcoin is a good buy at current prices, consider spreading out, over the next year, whatever amount you want to put into it ‚Äì buying a little bit at regular intervals.

The idea would still be to try to buy low. It‚Äôs just that, instead of trying to pin the tail on the donkey at the specific point at which prices might be lowest, you‚Äôd be entering at the average price over a period during which bitcoin would likely hit its bottom ‚Äì which is far safer.","Now that bitcoin is dead (again), is it time to buy?",7

You don't control what happens in the world, or in the macroeconomic environment, or what the price of bitcoin is going to do tomorrow, but you can control how you will react in those circumstances. If there is nothing to do, you shouldn't worry about it. If you can do something, then you also shouldn't worry. Currently I'm -23% negative, and the only thing I can do now is buy cheap sats and that's what Im going to do.

I'm 100% into bitcoin since 2019, my time horizon is 5, 10 years from now, so I have nothing to worry about in the short-term. Bitcoin won't go to zero, if that happens, something very bad happened to humanity and bitcoin would be the least of your problems.

I know I just lost some good coin but I'm glad I did. I had never been in a position my entire life until last year to purchase past my needs and was excited to finally get into the market. 

All of my cryptos were on Coinbase, which makes trading easy but with all of their fees and being a centralized platform the meaning of what cryptos are supposed to be was lost. When I start buying again in a month or two I will be putting all my coins in cold storage.

I fell for the hype... my social media is filled with conartists using words like ""parabolic"" ""Anchor = infinite money"" and ""Options trading"". I lost my principles on why I wanted in in the first place.


I will be back, but I am thankful I got what I did out of the markets and will be able to put that money towards my family and getting in at a later date.


Love you all",I sold at 28k last night.... and I'm glad I did!,4

Almost every country‚Äôs economy is crumbling. USA, China, Japan (the Yen is facing a crisis). Not to mention that countries are realizing that the US will confiscate their assets for ‚Äúreasons‚Äù. You‚Äôre about to see a dumping of US treasuries like the world has never seen. Who‚Äôs going to have to buy those up? The Fed. Guess what this means? Higher inflation (Fed must buy to keep prices up meaning that rates go down making inflation worse).

&amp;nbsp;

Why is BTC going down? There are no **SPOT** buyers to match the sellers. But what are the sellers selling into? USD @ 20% inflation (CPI is not inflation). The truth is that if rates go up, we will have a recession. If rates don‚Äôt go up we will have a depression. 

You‚Äôre watching the death of fiat right now and if you‚Äôre selling BTC, you‚Äôre buying fiat.

&amp;nbsp;

While bitcoin is the majority of my cryptocurrency, I own a non-trivial amount of altcoins, which had, until recently, been doing much better than bitcoin. I had been racking my brains, trying to figure out how to divest myself of the altcoins. What has prevented me from doing this is the insane capital gains that would have been incurred. Anyone who has had to do crypto taxes knows that even seemingly minor changes to a portfolio can have serious tax consequences.

I have always refused to sell down my crypto to pay for the taxes on capital gains and extra income, preferring instead to just pay the taxes from wages and keep the coin invested. Now, with everything crashing, I can still trade crap coins for bitcoin at a modest profit in bitcoin terms, and not take such a great hit to the wallet come tax time next year.

When you buy Bitcoin you'll have one part of 21 million coins. Forever. That's the promise and that's never going to change. The worth of one Bitcoin inside the Bitcoin Network keeps rising forever because of the limited cap and lost coins. The price in Dollar or Euro is irrelevant. It's just the entry price for interacting on the network. 
Bitcoin is not just the coin.
The Bitcoin network will be the foundation of a new kind of internet which will be build on second, third and forth layer networks like lightning, taro/rgb,.... 
Right now, in 2022 Bitcoin is just like the internet in the mid 90s. Clumsy and hard to understand for the average user. People are still talking about the limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain. Those people didn't understand Bitcoin at all (yet). I think in the future nobody will ever do a transaction on the Blockchain. Everyone will only use lightning apps. 
The Blockchain is just a settlement layer that no regular person needs to interact with.
I'm convinced that the usecase of the Bitcoin network will be even greater than the internet. We already have the Internet of information. Bitcoin is the Internet of values. 

Like I said, Bitcoin is the safest way to store your wealth. Safer than stocks, real estate, commodities, cryptos, NFTs or whatever. Everything has more risks than Bitcoin.
But as long as you don't get why, you should treat it as a highly speculative stock.

And, some suggested to simply HODL and let the eventual rise in value be enough return, and not to lend out my BTC just to earn a few sats (the gains of which would be paltry in comparison in the long run). And that lending would open me up to counter-party risk. 

We can see very clearly with some shitcoins fizzling out that a key value of Bitcoin is being able to hold your own keys, and exercise your financial Sovereignty, with no counter-party risk.  

Your keys, your coins. 

Not your keys, not your coins.

It is essential that we protect healthy price discovery for Bitcoin and hence it is time now before it's too late, before real Bitcoin follows paper Bitcoin to an early GRAVE, that we CREATE A PRICE INDEX BASED ON GOOD SPOT EXCHANGES AND AGREE AS A COMMUNITY TO USE IT, IF WE DO THIS IN THE SAME UASF SPIRIT EVERYONE WILL FOLLOW AND THE GAME WILL BE UP FOR THE MANIPULATORS WITHIN A FEW HOURS OF US AGREEING TO DO THIS SHORTS ON THESE BETTING PLATFORMS WILL BE GETTING REKT.

THE TIME IS NOW AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE MAIN SOURCE OF OUR PROBLEMS. THIS IS A GAPING WOUND IN BITCOIN WE NEED TO APPLY PRESSURE.

post,vawvo1,2s3qj,bitcoin,false,1655071968,https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/vawvo1/bullishness_or_bs/,self.bitcoin,,"Since around February this year, Bitcoin's become so much less volatile than in the past - this has certainly lead some to change their views on whether it's just a hotbed of speculative insanity, or something that can actually hold some long term value. With the current state of the market I've been witnessing mostly bullish attitudes being shared, many of which flash predictions of skyrocketing prices at 'some point soon'. 

However, every single optimistic news article I see is quickly offset by reports of its increasingly struggling performance. Bitcoin's overall decaying value and deceleration has made me inclined to believe that its period of strong bullishness and optimisim is over - that the best-case scenario for it currently is that it'll adopt a role of a more stable cryptocurrency, and consequently deflate to more stable values, or worst-case, it's set to fade from relevance, and what we're seeing now is just those who have significant amounts of bitcoin promoting bullishness in order to prop the market up long enough so they can cash out. 

I'll still be holding on to my bitcoin anyway, because lord knows it has a reputation for subverting everyone's expectations, and I still have some faith left. Nonetheless, I am currently finding it hard to see a way forward for Bitcoin to regain value in the coming months and return to prominence, especially considering the increased regulatory challenges crypto is gonna be facing. 

What's everyone's opinion on this? Are there any other potential paths forward for Bitcoin?",Bullishness or BS?,3

Coinbase defines it as ""The median time that Coinbase customers hold BTC before selling it or sending it to another account or address. **What this means:** Long hold time signals an accumulation trend. Short hold time indicates increased movement of tokens. Last updated 6/12/2022, 5:01 AM""  


What are logical interpretations/insights from the this steadily rising? And if a lot more people are using cold wallets etc why is it steadily rising? (is the pace that people are holding btc on Coinbase outpacing those who are hodling with cold wallets?)

I never decided to buy any BTC even when it was just a few cents, because I didn't understand the tech. I just never understood the whitepaper and since 2012 i have read the whitepaper 2 times as well as listened to over 12 hours of lectures on bitcoin and the tech.

Well after 10 years I am finally the owner of 0.001 bitcoins and I am so happy! I dream that in another 10 years my Bitcoin will be worth over a million or two (give or take) dollars (LOL thanks inflation!).

Better late than never as my parents always said. I am so proud of myself I am literally trembling while I type this. My coins are on coinbase which is where i purchased them from and thats where they are stored atm.

Many people suggested that I buy a hardware wallet to cold storage my bit of coins and I will get on that ASAP. I am taking off of work tomorrow to go over my options of hardware wallet and I will pull the trigger on a device hopefully in the next 24 hours. Right now my two top contenders are ledger disk wallet and trezors but i will need more time to research 

I will feel much safer getting my ~$30 of bitcoins off of coinbase and onto my cold storaged wallet.

I have a question regarding Bitcoin‚Äôs spam prevention mechanisms. For instance, consider a Bitcoin node (let‚Äôs say connected to 125 other nodes) participated in the mining of Bitcoin. What is stopping them from sending false proofs of work to their peers in order to overload their servers? BTW, by false proofs of work, I mean that a node is providing its peers with a proof of work that does not correspond to the difficulty level of that block. For instance, sending hashes that are greater than the given target. 

I‚Äôve considered the fact the spammer‚Äôs peers would be able to identify the malicious actions and ultimately eject the attacker from the network. But how does it prevent from the spam node from IP spoofing/hiding identity and reconnecting and spamming the network again?

I might be a bit of a techie, but not a computer programmer by any stretch, so my PoV might still be biased. 

Anyway, my advice for someone in that position would be to save those 50-100$ and instead do something like this:

* Find a computer, do a fresh install of ubuntu.
* Install electrum, generate a wallet.
* Write down the 12/24 words on paper/metal, hide them in a safe place.
* Export xpub from electrum and import it on bluewallet (ios, android)
* Erase ubuntu and return the computer to its previous use.
* From then on, generate addresses in bluewallet 

Can you help me gauge how hard could it be for a non tech-savvy person to attempt this? Where could they go wrong? How to make it easier? 

e.g. do they even need to start from a fresh ubuntu install? That extra precaution might discourage some people, but tbf, unless you have a malware infested pc, how bad would it be to just do this on an existing windows partition? heck, how bad could it be to do everything on a smartphone even? (provided you delete the private key once it's been copied and xpub exported). 

My frustration comes from the countless times I read people believing their coins are stored on the HW wallet itself. The very term ""cold storage"" is misleading, and leads to a lot of wrong asusmptions and doubts. We should do better than this. Mind you, i use a ledger to sign transactions and send coins myself, so I know what a hw wallet is useful for. I know it's not really necessary if all you want to do is just DCA and let your coins sit for some years. It'll come a time where you'll want to move/spend your coins, that's the moment you should buy a wallet. Use those money today to buy btc instead! 100$ might not sound like a lot for people in developed country, but that sure does not apply to everyone. Everyone can self custody at zero cost, they shouldn't be discouraged!

I am just wondering how do you actually cope with the crypto situation ? 
Many of you boarded the crypto train during the period of great anticipation and almost at the top.
Many of you have sold at a loss and others just hodl.
 
I wonder what you want to do next.  If we are in crypto winter, will you buy more?  Or let your investment climb and wait for further growth.  Those who sold - are you going to buy again or do you no longer believe in crypto ?

My own experience is more than a year old and very negative.  At the time, I thought I would never touch the crypto again, but now I'm considering investing again, believing that my loss could be compensated.

Quite often I read here that crypto winter can last 2-3 years.  Do you think that crypto might not get on its ATH again at all ?

Do any of you think Crypto might not survive this period at all ? 

Please let me know your opinion.",How do you experience these times?,1

1. Isn't there the possibility that a future Bitcoin Improvement Protocol fucks with ""first-gen"" hardware wallets and makes them obsolete?
2. Isn't ""data-rot"" a real concern with hardware wallets?
3. How are hardware wallets safer if I still have to connect them to the internet to receive/send Bitcoin? Don't hardware wallets need to be connected to internet-enabled devices to receive and send?
4. Hardware wallets can be hacked and they can also be sent from the manufacturer with pre-installed malware. How does the wallet being open-sourced make a difference in this regard?

Ultimately, I wish to purchase a hardware wallet ONCE, send BTC to it quarterly, and never have to think about software updates, manufacturers going out of business, and the device/device app interface being hacked.",Hardware Wallet Questions,5

After understanding money and what BTC represent to our world, I find such a control over my impulses to buy something totally unnecessary. 

I remember being a guy obsessed with new phones, headphones etc etc but now those impulse to stress buy, or just to seek a quick dopamine hit to buy new stuff is almost dying. 

Having said that, another beautiful thing that happened with me is that when I really want to buy something, I almost end up buying the best quality product that would last for longer time. For eg. I was traveling in Milan, before starting a new job and absolutely wanted to buy really good quality leather shoes (never had high quality leather shoes before). I walked into a really good quality store in Milan and picked up 2 pair of shoes that were around 500 euros. The most expensive shoes I ever bought in life but I know these will last me good decade with all the care. Hence, saving all the money for decade that I would have otherwise spend on buying cheap and bad quality leather shoes. 

BTC has reduced my time preference. Made me want to invest more long term on every thing now. 

I hope this change was observed by many people in their lives. 

Would love to hear if that is the case!!",Being a BTC maxi made so less consumerist!!,98

When money has no scarcity, prices have no ceiling.  House prices have skyrocketed because sellers sell at the upper bounds of what people can borrow.  It's a neverending upwards death spiral and why modern urban centers have median 3BD/2BA house prices of $1.5MM.

This is why we have inflation out of control.  So much money created from thin air over the pandemic.   That spreads well beyond housing to all consumer goods.  

So central banks have to do the unpopular thing: raise interest rates and make money more scarce.  The classic boom and bust of moronic Keynesian economics.  If you're ""lucky"", the bust actually works, the lowest income get hurt the most, but social order remains, prices come down, and the cycle starts again.  The alternative is you can't stop inflation and then the truly terrifying reality begins. 

Bitcoin is fixed, predictable scarcity. It is not created from debt and pulling interest rate levers. If you can't create ""free money"", you actually get real prices (""price discovery""). Houses become affordable because people can only buy what they can afford and sellers can only charge what people can pay. 

Housing supply is further improved because investors won't be interested in inventory when there's no skyrocketing appreciation - there are better places to put capital for higher returns.  You make housing affordable, you create far more stability.

It can still survive with transaction fees from the users. But from i understand the node that gets to mine the block will get to write on the block chain right?

Furthermore I saw number of crypto ""news"" websites echoing the same thing.

 I am native Lithuanian speaker so i decided to dig deeper and read the ACTUAL proposal instead of spreading bs.

**The proposal in lithuanian reads as follows:** 

*‚Äû211. Virtuali≈≥j≈≥ valiut≈≥ keityklos operatoriui ir depozitini≈≥ virtuali≈≥j≈≥ valiut≈≥ pinigini≈≥ operatoriui draud≈æiama atidaryti anonimines sƒÖskaitas ar sƒÖskaitas akivaizd≈æiai fiktyviais vardais, taip pat atidaryti sƒÖskaitas ar kitaip pradƒóti dalykinius santykius nepareikalavus kliento tapatybƒô patvirtinanƒçi≈≥ duomen≈≥ arba kilus pagrƒØstam ƒØtarimui, kad ≈°iuose dokumentuose ƒØra≈°yti duomenys yra netikri ar suklastoti.‚Äú*

**The proposal translated with google:**

*‚Äû211. The virtual currency exchange operator and the depository virtual currency wallet operator are prohibited from opening anonymous accounts or accounts under manifestly fictitious names, or from opening or otherwise entering into business relationships without requesting customer identification data or if there is a reasonable suspicion that the data contained in these documents is inaccurate.*

The key point to know is that **the depository virtual currency wallet operator (depozitini≈≥ virtuali≈≥j≈≥ valiut≈≥ pinigini≈≥ operatorius)** has a definition which is a as follow in Lithuanian:

 *Depozitini≈≥ virtuali≈≥j≈≥ valiut≈≥ pinigini≈≥ operatorius¬†‚Äì depozitini≈≥ virtuali≈≥j≈≥ valiut≈≥ pinigini≈≥ valdymo klient≈≥ vardu paslaugas teikiantis Lietuvos Respublikoje ƒØsteigtas juridinis asmuo arba Lietuvos Respublikoje ƒØsteigtas Europos SƒÖjungos valstybƒós narƒós ar u≈æsienio valstybƒós juridinio asmens filialas.*

**The definition translated with google:**

*Depository virtual currency wallet operator -*  *a legal (****juridical****) entity established in the Republic of Lithuania or a branch of a legal (****juridical****) entity of a Member State of the European Union or a foreign state established in the Republic of Lithuania providing services for the management of deposit virtual currencies.*

&amp;#x200B;

**The key point here is the word juridical which mean a separate legal entity and not an actual person. If you are a private person with Ledger wallet YOU ARE NOT a ""depository virtual currency wallet operator"". So this whole legislation is actual aimed to the crypto companies and exchanges which will have to be more diligent when verifying user information. You will not be able to have an anonymous CEX account even when dealing with small amounts.**

**To be fair you already had to verify with CEX if you wanted to buy or sell sums of &gt;1000eur or withdraw money, so for everyday user this doesn't change things much. I decided to write this up because IMO the mis-information does much more harm than good.**

TL,DR: Ledgers will not be banned, stop panicking. Also stop spreading false information.","No, Lithuania will not ban non-custodial wallets. Stop spreading false information.",128

 *That's a complex mess and there's unlikely to be a decimal anywhere except for micropayments on the LN. My recent trip to El Salvador is where is clicked. Nobody uses the word sats, and nobody distinguishes whole coins. They simply call it bitcoin. ""Diez mil bitcoin"" which is 10,000 bitcoin, or sats to us, and is enough for a meal for two at a restaurant. It's infinitely easier to understand and when you hear it spoken live, it makes perfect sense. In multi-currency countries and ones where amounts are expressed in large numbers (like most of Latin America, but Japan, Indonesia, and parts of Africa too), they're quite used to this.* 

&amp;#x200B;

I day traded shit coins in the beginning just to get an idea for it and of course used money I could afford to lose.  While doing that I was researching and doing a lot off DD.  I was hooked.  I quickly realized BTC is where you would want to put USD especially if one has a long term strategy 10 years+.  I have been putting every bit of spare cash and started to cut back on going out to dinner all the time and whatever stupid stuff I would spend.  I have been hooked listening to podcasts about Bitcoin it‚Äôs all I really listen to.  With all that being said, I just thought of something and I can‚Äôt move past it, and no way my wife is going to give me feedback with this.   

If we look at Bitcoin as a store of Value using a Michael Saylor lense.  I would agree with what he says about, picking our battles.  Focus on educating to move the 12 trillion dollars that‚Äôs invested into a basically useless medal in modern age.  My question is if the dollar has depreciated 90% through its life already and it‚Äôs just getting worse with inflation, and Bitcoin being denominated by USD, and the dollar ends up collapsing from inflation, that would mean the west and western values would collapse in the World Order.  Well, who would take our place? China is next in line‚Ä¶Bitcoin would now be worthless because everything will be in Yuan.  So why are we focusing our battle against the dollar and rooting for it all to collapse.  The dollar collapses China will be ruling the world and Bitcoin will be worthless because it doesn‚Äôt have Fighter Jets or Nuclear weapons.",Bitcoin and USD connection.,5

Disclaimer: I love bitcoin and I‚Äôm here since 2017. So don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a hater or I want to spread FUD. 

_Bitcoin can‚Äôt be banned, but can be made useless?_

No one can ban bitcoin and also telling this is a funny sentence. But what EU can do is making bitcoin useless for us and profitable for them!


_How EU is manking bitcoin useless_

EU is trying to make bitcoin useless with all the upcoming laws against un- hosted wallets. Sending bitcoin to an unhosted wallet from exchanges will require to verify your unhosted wallet, and if you try to send them to other unhosted wallet you could risk to keep those bitcoin locked an no more accepted by exchanges or to explain what you did with them. I think they are playing on this: they are trying to make bitcoin something you buy on CEX and do just nothing with them. So useless. Bitcoin is meant to be transferred and used to exchange value not to buy a SQL tuple on a CEX database.
This way they will get rid of all the troubles about uncontrollable money, and also they will earn on it with taxes, after they made it useless.

_What we are doing to avoid this_

Nothing! Just nothing! I don‚Äôt want to be harsh but many of us just cover their eyes telling ‚Äúbitcoin can‚Äôt be banned‚Äù, ‚Äúbitcoin will be the future‚Äù etc etc. ok but do we want to realize we are in trouble now and we, as a community of bitcoiners, should act to change events and not just watch all what is happening in EU?

_What can we do?_

I don‚Äôt know, but we should do something before it‚Äôs too late! We can‚Äôt keep watching EU destroying bitcoin with stupid restrictions like that latest news in Lithuania. So please, we all get aware this is a thing and we should find some functional ways to protest!


Sorry for my bad English I‚Äôm from Italy.

Why not 0.09 BTC or 0.12 BTC?

I think having one tenth of a full bitcoin is a great psychological milestone. That's 10 million sats.

In a hyperbitcoinization scenario, 0.10 BTC is going to be a huge amount of money. And even if we don't go hyper, I'm sure 0.10 BTC is going to work great as an emergency fund in the near future.

You won't be able to afford buying 0.10 BTC in a few years. Do it now that it's only $3k or less.

That's it.

Other milestones I like:

0.33 BTC (one third of a bitcoin)

0.50 BTC (half a bitcoin)

1 BTC (whole coiner)

3 BTC (probably enough to retire in the next 5 years or so)

10 BTC (multimillionaire status)","Everyone should aim for at least 0.10 BTC right now. I think this is the bare minimum. If you have less than that, stack HARD my friend.",30

But when I tell people that they need to get a seat on that train or it will leave the station...well, one person made an argument that got me nicely.  

He said ""what's the point of hodling your Bitcoin and say it does moon hard, what will you do with the money, if your policy is to hodl indefinitely then you will end up dying with big numbers on a screen.""  

But, what's the alternative?  To die broke.  I mean, if you don't die with big numbers on a screen, then that means you die with small numbers, meaning you're broke.  Or nearly so.  And, I don't want to die broke, folks.  I had an uncle who did just that, lived in a garage with a dirt floor and had no luxuries for his retired years.  He died broke.  I don't want that. 

So yeah, he's right.  I'll die with big numbers on a screen.  If I'm lucky.  What do you guys think?","People tell me ""You're going to die with big numbers on a screen."" Have you ever gotten that before? Let's reflect on that.",9

A more academic version of the article on the Nasdaq with links to sources, instead of like the previous link that more so tries to use imagery to better relay the message: [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-fixes-the-modern-fiat-ponzi-scheme-2021-09-14](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-fixes-the-modern-fiat-ponzi-scheme-2021-09-14)

It's sad that people don't see this yet, but Bitcoin has started a fascinating trend that leads people down a rabbit whole of financial education that allows them to see this fiat Ponzi and Securities Pyramid scheme for the scans they are.

We only have a few hundred million people today in this space, and I'd say only a few tens of millions have been in it long enough learning about it, to better comprehend the giant scam with extra steps that is the traditional financial system.

What happens in 4 years when we're projecting over a billion users, and likely by then a few hundred million users who've learned enough about the financial system to understand the scam that it is? Will we get the revolution over night that Henry Ford prophesized?

If not then, then what happens in 10 years when we project 5+ billion users with a few billions having learned enough to better understand the Fiat Ponzi and Securities Pyramid scams with extra steps?

If you're a long time hodler then you already know what happens. Eventually your banks fails you as they do everyone all the time, and Bitcoin offers you a work around. After that, things become much clearer seeing how Bitcoin can do for you everything your bank does for you without all the inefficiency's.

Even getting loans against your Bitcoin is an easier process with better rates than a banking loan, and anyone who's been in long enough to start doing that has learned enough to only ever do it with the smallest portion of their holdings to not be at risk of not having more Bitcoin in reserves to cover a margin call.

**F.A. Hayek** once said:  [""I don't believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can't take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can't stop.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-uo-KfnkhI)

So tell me, what happens in 20 years when 7+ billions of people are projected to be using Bitcoin like people have grown to use email today, and even more billions having learned enough from their curiosity in it to see the old financial system for the giant convoluted scam that it is?

Bitcoin's adoption rate has held strong for 13 years, and for those thirteen years it has grown at twice the speed of the first internet.

If you study what happens to adoptees after they start studying Bitcoin and the financial system, to better understand why Bitcoin goes up in value over time like it does,  then you know the usual result is we Hodlers start denominating everything in Bitcoin, saving in Bitcoin. And dollars and other fiat currencies? Well we keep as few those as we need. Hell the oldest of us in this space don't keep any dollars anymore. We have credit and debit cards that we can pay with our Bitcoin so we never have to touch that fiat shit again.

 **PS: Ford helped create the modern central banking system we have today. It‚Äôs described in a book called ‚Äú*****The creature from Jekyll Island‚Äù*****. The book describes Henry Ford, JP Morgan, and a bunch of other billionaires(When adjusted for inflation) meeting at a private island to reinvent our banking system, which resulted in the creation of the private Federal Reserve banking system we have today, who is owned by all of Americas Chartered banks, as they're the only ones allowed to own a stake of its shares. So if he‚Äôs saying people would revolt over night if they understood it, then you know it‚Äôs got to be bad because the guy and his friends created it.** ","Inflation always reminds me of one of Henry Ford's most famous quotes: ""'It is perhaps well enough that the people of the nation do not know or understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning'""",83

the passphrase: toto titi tata tete.

The two specialists supported the Pune Special Investigation Team (SIT). The Pune police cyber cell has verified that about 1,300 bitcoins have gone stolen from the wallets of cyber specialists Ghode and Patil. It represents an improvement in crypto related transactions. Projects like Concordium have introduced ID recognition before crypto transactions but it remains largely un-adopted.

The offenders were apprehended by cyber police during an investigation that began in April 2021. On allegations of stealing bitcoins for financial benefit while supporting the police throughout the inquiry, the forces took several mobile phones, MacBooks, hard drives, tabs, computers, CDs, and other materials from their possession.

On Monday, the Pune Police Cyber Crime Cell issued a 4,400-page charge sheet against two cyber specialists. Patil admitted to taking 237 bitcoins, according to Deputy Commissioner of Police Bhagyashree Navtake. Ghode is accountable for about 900 bitcoins that have gone missing. Over $770,000 in 34 different cryptocurrencies was reportedly confiscated by authorities as they probed an alleged 900 bitcoin difference. 

Patil and Ghode are now being held in judicial custody at Pune's Yerawada Central Jail. According to officials, Patil was an IPS officer for a few years before departing. 
He has been working as a cybercrime specialist since then. He supported different police departments and investigation organizations, as well as training officers on crypto-crime. 

Ghode has worked as a cyber security expert and operated multiple firms, including some based abroad.
The accused officers are believed to manipulate the screenshots of bitcoin recovery and submit them as proof to the police as part of their investigation report.",Former Police Experts Tried to Escape With Millions of Seized Bitcoins,42

It‚Äôs a recovery phrase ‚Äì a set of 12-24 random words crypto wallets generate for you to access your assets. Wallets are used to store private keys, while seed phrases are the master passwords to them. If your wallet is removed or lost, the seed phrase will help you to restore it.

**How does a seed phrase work?**

You receive a seed phrase when you create your own wallet. It‚Äôs randomly chosen from a list of 2048 words as established by the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39.

**How to store the seed phrase securely?**

You can write it down and keep copies in safe places, keep it spread around in various safe private locations or engrave it into a durable material such as stainless steel and waterproof paper.

**What happens if you lose a seed phrase?**

Unfortunately, your crypto is lost. It won‚Äôt disappear, it‚Äôll stay on the blockchain and you won‚Äôt have any way to access it.

**The difference between a seed phrase and a private key**

Private keys are meant to spend your coins and tokens. A seed phrase allows you to access all private keys in the wallet.

**Storing your seed phrase with a third party**

This way you won‚Äôt risk forgetting where you captured the phrase. However, you‚Äôll be at a higher risk of hacks and you won‚Äôt be in full control of your funds.",A seed phrase is an essential attribute of the cryptocurrency world.

If you look at this article [https://coinweek.com/ancient-coins/worth-purchasing-power-ancient-coins/](https://coinweek.com/ancient-coins/worth-purchasing-power-ancient-coins/) at section Soldier's pay "" Another way of thinking about the labor equivalent of ancient coins is soldier‚Äôs pay ‚Äì one of the most important items in the budget of ancient empires. In the fourth century BCE, Greek *hoplites* (armored infantry) typically received a drachma per day (sometimes supplemented by another drachma to pay for a servant while on campaign)\[9\]. Computed as an annual salary, this represents about 1,540 grams of silver or, converted into gold at the typical ancient 15:1 rate, 103 g of gold (about three-and-a-third troy ounces). 

 

Roman soldiers were paid 225 denarii per year, beginning in the first century BCE and continuing until the reign of the emperor **Domitian** (ruled 81-96 CE), who raised the rate to 300 denarii. That would represent about 972 grams of silver or 64.8 grams of gold (a bit over two troy ounces).

Now consider a modern soldier‚Äôs pay. A US Army E-2 with less than two years service earns a base pay of $20,808\[10\]. That would buy over 40 kilograms of silver, or about 555 grams (18.2 troy ounces) of gold at current rates. So in terms of the gold standard, Americans value a foot soldier more than five times as highly as ancient Greeks, and more than eight times as much as ancient Romans did.""

If gold was really an inflation hedge shouldnt 103g of gold should be enough for a years wage? I am really confused by this claim and even if i wanted to diversity it wouldnt be for such a shitty thing that already lost 99.99% of its value.",Why is gold considered an inflation hedge?,1

This is more for my own personal interest and wanting to tinker and learn more about different implementations. I want to be able to experiment building and configuring a new node while I know I have another one left alone and running smoothly.

Right now I have a Pi running Core, EPS, and Electrum Wallet (thank you u/armantheparman for the guides on your website!). It is working with outbound and inbound connections (though I didn't need to do port forwarding on my router... maybe because I have it configured to use Tor and a proxy?).

The new one I'm working on runs on Ubuntu Server on a NUC (a much faster initial block download!). I've got Bitcoin Core running with outbound connections. I'd like it to support inbound connections too without disrupting the Pi. I'm looking at all the information the command `bitcoind -?` spits out and there is a lot I don't understand. For example, this is the level of introductory networking that I am finding helpful: [http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/tcpip-ports-sockets/](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/tcpip-ports-sockets/). I know *how* to navigate my router and change settings, and I know *how* to add firewall rules in Ubuntu, but I don't know *what* specifically to configure these things to.

Does anyone have specific recommendations for a dual node setup? Should I just configure one of them to use a port other than 8333 and be done with it? My understanding is that the port number doesn't need to be 8333 for other nodes to find me, especially if I use the ""addnode"" option and use my other node to connect me to the network.

Even general networking resources (not Bitcoin specific) are appreciated!",How to best configure multiple nodes (and the router) on the same home network?,1

post,v8tyl8,2s3qj,bitcoin,false,1654817380,https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/v8tyl8/extending_divisibility_how_would_it_actually_be/,self.bitcoin,,"During a recent episode of ""What is Money,"" Greg Foss argued that as bitcoin absorbs the market cap of international energy trade, the price should reach at least $2 million at today's value of the dollar. He didn't give a timeframe but this could realistically happen within 10 years.

That would mean a satoshi would be worth $0.02 in today's value. A gallon of gas would be 250-300 sats, pound of ground beef 300-400 sats, etc. While Lightning can handle some of that load, and already uses fractions of a sat, I still don't think bitcoin is divisible enough once the real value is that high. So there should be an extension in subdivisions: instead of a sat being a hundred millionth of a bitcoin, perhaps it's a hundred billionth (retaining the satoshi's definiton as the smallest subdivision of bitcoin).

It strikes me that there are 2 primary questions that bitcoiners need to have answered, preferably before it becomes an active problem:

1. Exactly how would a subdivision upgrade be implemented. I don't know enough about the protocol at the OPCODE level to know if it would require a fork; please God no.
2. What are the specific conditions that would warrant extending sub-divisibility. 

Thoughts?","Extending divisibility, how would it actually be accomplished?",2

Generally speaking, there is a very apparent roadblock to mainstreaming Bitcoin and that is, of course, education. The uncertainty of what it is and what it does is the largest barrier to entry. If the general population was educated about Bitcoin through a casual viewing platform, Netflix, it would be the most effective way to educate everyday people to make their own decision with their money and unveil the mysterious world of Bitcoin. This would have the broadest reach for those who have not made the leap to do their own research yet.

Topics to discuss:

* What is money?
* What is the history of money and what value does it bring to the human race?
* What are the pros and cons of a gold standard?
* What is a fiat currency?
* Why does inflation occur?
* How does an inflationary currency cause harm to people?
* What is Bitcoin?
* How does Bitcoin work?
* Why is Bitcoin secure?
* What does Bitcoin allow us to do?

These are just a few topics and could be discussed by experts in the field such as Saifedean Ammous, Michael Saylor, etc...

1) Interest rates are manipulated to record lows and the money printer is turned up to high to ensure the protection of the populace from evil deflation and hard times.

2) Inflation never arises and economists that were predicting inflation are ridiculed.

3) Eventually an excuse arises to print record amounts of fiat causing the central banks balance sheet to skyrocket.

4) Inflation begins to rise but is ignored and dismissed.

5) The expansion of the money supply increases aggregate demand simply because there is more money chasing the same number of goods available. 

6) This rise in demand caused by money printing is inaccurately mistaken as a fall in supply and price rises are blamed on otherwise common natural disasters and other external factors out of the control of government.

7) After the natural disasters and other excuses have ended price rises continue so they get blamed on businesses who are labelled evil price gougers.

8) Price controls are put in place to stop businesses raising their prices.

9) These price controls prevent businesses from being able to make a profit so they go out of business.

10) As price controls destroy businesses this collapses supply causing prices to start rising even faster as food shortages begin triggering protests and riots in the street.

11) Finally central banks agressively hike rates to a level above the rate of inflation to reign it in. The entire time rate rises have been the only answer to controlling inflation.

12) At this point if you are a low debt country you face a deep recession and asset market collapse but can recover eventually. If you are a high debt country the rise in interest rates pushes government debt into a sovereign debt crisis and you enter the realm of Zimbabwe Argentina and Turkey with a deep recession and hyperinflation simultaneously.

I feel like there should be an easy to understand visual representation of this process so people can see in real time the lies that the government will inevitably spout to push the blame for inflation from themselves onto everyone and everything else.

The reason raising rates and reducing government spending is the answer to reigning in inflation is becuase lowering rates and increasing government spending is what caused it in the first place. Or as the famous Milton Friedman says ""Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon"".

And the final step of course is no matter the outcome, recession or hyperinflation, saving your wealth in bitcoin is the answer to protect yourself and family.",Something I think everyone should have a copy of to send to friends and familiy is a step by step playbook for how inflation starts and how government blames everyone but themselves.

post,v8gbjx,2s3qj,bitcoin,false,1654779596,https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/v8gbjx/what_if/,self.bitcoin,,"Hi there fellow Bitcoiners,

&amp;#x200B;

I was pondering about Bitcoin and it's network. I'm getting deeper and deeper into Bitcoin and moving away from all the ""new and improved coins"" that emerge every single day. 

I started running Umbrel with a Bitcoin Node and Lightning (which makes transactions awesomely cheap). So i'm getting in deeper and deeper into ""the one coin that rules them all"".

But there is a question stuck in my mind for a long time and what better way then to ask here. 

The What if, and let's assume that we are not talking about 1 or 2 mining farms or nodes but for the sake of it, let's make it a 80-90% case. 

So what if 80-90%:

1.  What if miners power down due to regulations
2. What if miners power down due to the rise in electricity bills (the government could make mining super expensive because it's ""not green"".
3. What will happen if 2 of the above take place?
4. What if ALL mining is banned with a worldwide hunt on miners. What will happen to the network? Nodes alone can't process the transactions.
5. What is the ""crackdown"" on big miners in a joint force attempt to ban Bitcoin (to force CBDC's on people). Miners shutdown and the ""New World Order"" does a 51% attack. 

I keep reading that Bitcoin is the one true option against the money printer due to it's fixed cap. I keep reading that the network is super secure above other chains. This is true, until the above happens. 

After years of reading about it, trying a whole lotta different crypto i keep coming back to btc. And the above situation is something i can't find anywhere to be answered. 

Cheers.",What if...,4

Read many posts about strategies but the only one that helped me really were the advice to hold, no matter what. 
Today the adoption is much more advanced and so the actual  lowest price is much higher since then. Holding worked out in this years. Forget the noise between. 
Now in this winter the big players watch calm for the cheapest price available and rebuy back in big and fast if they have the feeling the very bottom is in and then soon the fomo will ride it up again to new higher highs. Adoption will continue to grow with new generations. 
You only will survive this game with discipline and focus on getting more BTC.
If you manage to get 1 BTC you are one of max 21 Millions in the world! No one will ever change this maximum. 
If you sell (in panic) you lose on the long run. If you try to time the market you will lose too.
Holding is sometimes painful but easy to handle. only a few ppl have the luck to buy at the right time. Don‚Äôt watch the short run.
It should be your only way and it will reward you in the future. No financial advice but my very true feeling.","The game is always the same: wait for winterbottom, don‚Äôt panic and buy more before cryptosummer comes.",20

So the Freedom Convoy news kinda dwindled down and I decided to look up how it ended.  
Turns out Trudeau got sick of it and ordered police to use gas and arrest everyone aaaand wait for it, blacklist crypto addresses from local exchanges associated with the bitcoin donations.

So the donation address distributed funds to other addresses to the truck drivers in the very emotional and inspirational video and now those addresses are blacklisted from all local exchanges.

Theoretically, a person can just send some/all funds to another address and avoid the blacklisting of that address?

OR, is the whole future chain of transactions are blacklisted?

*Early last week, Canada‚Äôs federal police ordered all crypto exchanges regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC)‚Äîthat‚Äôs most of them‚Äîto halt transactions associated with 34 crypto wallets associated with protesters and funds of $900,000.*",Can the government really blacklist bitcoin addresses?,5

It takes $5k at an average of $5 per coin to get 1000 btc and back then basically no one had the conviction to throw in more than $5k. So even people dollar cost averaging in for two years between early 2011 and late 2012 likely wouldnt even have reached 1000btc.

Early amateur miners were making 35 btc a day for months on end and they definitely stacked thousands. Shitcoin scammers have definitely turned their shitcoin rug pulls into thousands of btc, and a few lucky bitmex leverage traders hit it big making thousands of btc. But not many people were early miners, shitcoin scammers or lucky with leverage trading.

So if you remove them from the equation then its safe to assume most early adopters from 2011 and 2012 likely have more than 100 btc but less than 1000 btc, unless they took out large loans and dropped their life savings into it when it was $5 (which no one did).

I think people with more than 1000 btc today are extremely rare and not representative of the early adopter crowd. Most of the true OG early adopters have maybe a couple hundred btc not a couple thousand.","Only early miners, shitcoin scammmers and lucky leverage traders have more than 1000 BTC.",3

Where your eyes look, where you touch your phone. All affect prices. They have studied human emotion and behavior and set these high frequency algos to trade against these things. They also have it set up to where they can simply touch where they want the price to go within range of the time frame and WAIT and voila the price will magically go to that spot. We're being robbed and our privacy invaded at the same time. There's alot more but I'm pretty sure this is enough to get things exposed. While I have my tin foil hat on let me add that paper trading although not the same quantity you order still causes trades on the real market. 


(Added)  Here this is an easy way to see for yourself. 
https://aggr.trade/ set the time frame to 0.001 which is 1 millisecond. Turn the sound on and adjust where the speedometer thing is all the way to the left. Now move your eyes up then down, wave your hand in front. You can even walk away from the phone and turn your back to it and then wait until there's no trades and then roll your eyes and you'll soon see what I say is true. 


You can also go to ""Bitcoin liquidation watch"" on YouTube on your TV and regardless if you're TV has a camera or not you can first look at the active candle and then slowly start down directly under or above it whichever you want it to go and you'll freak out. Then you might realize how there's absolutely no privacy even within your own home on top of all the markets being a fraud. It's better you see for yourself so if I showed you I'd get accused of some deception. So find out for yourself. Or just drag your finger across your screen and you'll also see. 

Now if after this you people don't get it, then stay brainwashed sheep and good luck with that cuz I will get this out eventually and the entire thing is going to fall.

 If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  


 ¬†¬†¬† But make allowance for their doubting too;¬†¬†¬†  


 If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,  


 ¬†¬†¬† Or being lied about, don‚Äôt deal in lies,  


 Or being hated, don‚Äôt give way to hating,

 ¬†¬†¬† If you can think‚Äîand not make thoughts your aim;¬†¬†¬†  


 If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster  


 ¬†¬†¬† And treat those two impostors just the same;¬†¬†¬†  


 If you can bear to hear the truth you‚Äôve spoken  


 ¬†¬†¬† Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,  


 Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,  


 ¬†¬†¬† And stoop and build ‚Äôem up with worn-out tools:  


 If you can make one heap of all your winnings  


 ¬†¬†¬† And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,  


 And lose, and start again at your beginnings  


 ¬†¬†¬† And never breathe a word about your loss;  


 If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  


 ¬†¬†¬† To serve your turn long after they are gone,¬†¬†¬†  


 And so hold on when there is nothing in you  


 ¬†¬†¬† Except the Will which says to them: ‚ÄòHold on!‚Äô  


 If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,¬†¬†¬†  


 ¬†¬†¬† Or walk with Kings‚Äînor lose the common touch,

24/3 = 8

Come up with an 8 digit ""PIN""; e.g. the same one you use for your Ledger Nano.

Find a book. For example's sake, imagine your pin is 12345678:

1. go to page 10 (for ""1"") and with an invisible ink marker/highlighter, highlight letters in order down the page spelling out the first three words in your 24 word seed.
2. Go to page 20 (for ""2""; your second PIN-digit), highlight with your highlighter each letter (again, in order) of the next 3 words.
3. Rinse and repeat.
4. Hide book in plain sight; to better elude your PIN from prying bookworms (who may not even realize what they're looking at anyway), add red-herring annotations/notes in the book.

This is by no means the best method, but it's novel.

I broadly understand the argument for why Bitcoin can promote peace in the world, such as that an invading force can't take it by conquering land, that Bitcoin can flee across borders without detection, and most important to my question, that tyrannical governments can't fund endless wars on a Bitcoin standard, because they can't print Bitcoin.

But it's that final point that makes me wonder. In the case of a country or people that relies upon Bitcoin as its legal tender and reserve asset versus a country willing to print its state enforced fiat in order to fund war by robbing its citizens wealth and productivity... wouldn't the fiat tyranny have an advantage?

An example would be the American Civil War. The South had many powerful contingents that were not supportive of an overarching debt based currency to fund the war effort, they argued that breaking from a Gold standard was immoral, and some historians place that as central to its defeat - The North essentially outspent The South because their side was supportive of payment through federal IOUs. Obviously I'm not saying anything in regards to the morality of The South's stance on slavery, just the difference in funding of their war efforts.

So that's my concern. Hypothetically, if we Bitcoiners are to defend territory at some point in the future, against powerful governments willing to undermine their people and economies to extend their capacity to wage war against us, would we not hit the wall sooner than they?",Can Bitcoin Help A People Defend Against A Fiat Tyranny?,7

If you buy bitcoin and you leave it on the blockchain, all you need to do is save your seed phrase and you can get it later.

However, if you lend out your bitcoin to another business like an exchange, they will use your bitcoin.  They will figure out what to do with your bitcoin.  If they make a mistake and go bankrupt, you will not get all of your bitcoin back.

Bitcoin is kind of a pessimistic asset.  It goes up based on mismanagement of the world's currencies.  When things become terrible, bitcoin will go the moon.  In other words when bitcoin goes to the moon your exchange that borrowed bitcoin from you will probably go bankrupt and not return your coins to you.

That 10% yield is probably pretty pathetic now.

I would like to set up my own Bitcoin full node.  
After doing some research (on different websites), it more or less breaks down to some essential parts that one should provide/acquire in order run a full node. I will only be listing the parts, which I have questions about:

\- **Rasberry Pi 4 (8GB)**  
=&gt; Question: Does this have to be the 8GB version; would a 4GB version for example also be enough?

\- **SSD Hard drive (1 TB)**  
=&gt; Question: Why does this have to be a whole 1TB? Isn't this way too much? In other words, what would be the miminum storage space required?

\- **16GB Micro SD**  
=&gt; Question: Might be a dumb question, but this can also be a larger Mirco SD (128GB for example), correct? I have a spare one, that is why I am asking ..

&amp;#x200B;

These 3 questions are basically what I need to know. Please be kind with your answers, I am not really a techi-guy :)

They do this using Lightning Network. With less fees, instant settlement, permissionless and better privacy than the current system.

Time * work energy * security = fruition. Got it. 

But I was wrong. Or maybe I‚Äôm just elated that I‚Äôve almost managed to find a way to spend some curiously salted utxos, and also recognizing that I perhaps haven‚Äôt been amazing at taking the past few years in stride. 

Regardless, I‚Äôm still here in a sort of casual awe at how it creates perfect economic seasons where money can cool off. Where people can reflect. Yes. We also need rest. We aren‚Äôt ASICS that can take data 24/7, crunch it all, and not bug out. 

Sometimes Bitcoin is worth more (ironically, bear markets, once you see it), so you work harder for it then. That‚Äôs the case going forward, maybe the next year or two. Maybe be a little harder to find cheap steaks in the meantime. 

But I can rest assured knowing that all the energy I put through a PoW system such as Bitcoin allows me to know that the work I do as a human, which I also have to align with my ethics on a personal level, will only grow in value as epochs move on. 

Then there‚Äôs the inevitable expansion of bringing in new souls to Bitcoin every epoch. We all introduce our friends and family. They come in. Then you see them bringing in folks. They are learning now too finally, and they want to understand better what the properties are at the core. 

It‚Äôs like a heartbeat sort of, but one that happens only once every four years. An expanding pulse. More people interested, but only half as much supply suddenly available on futures market, which runs in backwardation to USD. 

That‚Äôs another thing that happened since coming across Bitcoin in grad school‚Äîit‚Äôs taught me about all sorts of other markets. 

Should pretty much be always two constants of the market‚ÄîBitcoin going up (hope rising from the ashes of pseudo-governments destroying their own money) and the VIX going down (people realizing shit is probably not going to be as bad as they feared). Else=print recession. 

There will always be forks, and gambling, and hash wars, until society sort of writ large learns to respect the internet (the ultimate time machine) as a whole really for the public depository (library) of codebase that it is

But it also means that mined pristine bitcoin is maybe easier to debug than bitcoin that has been salted a few times over, as it‚Äôs moved across time, and different platforms, and shot back and forth between nodes running different rules. 

I mean, even at it‚Äôs essence, every shitcoin out there currently sitting in some strange SIMS metaverse where you use it to pay for your dry cleaning, it‚Äôs ultimately just an extended expression of the Bitcoin ledger‚Äîsome history of transactions that has aged toward the graveyard of usability, by being exchanged over and over, but for the sake of novelty more than profit‚Äîover in the land of the present where every bad idea has surely been tried (let‚Äôs make a coin that tracks the supply chain, ugh) and even some good ones, have failed. 

I also suddenly get why Luke wants smaller blocks if we really want to make this something that will be attractive to people in 2070. And especially 2170. 

That sort of shit absolutely matters when you get to the point of devoting your life‚Äôs work toward using a money that is the bane of every other money‚Äôs existence. 

We aren‚Äôt just a bunch of nerds anymore. Militaries hire out kiddos like Jason Lowery these days just to better understand Bitcoin themselves. 

It literally feels like the beginning of an evolutionary bottleneck sometimes. 

And it‚Äôs why you probably want to be mining during these times of global peak energy, regardless of whether it costs a bit more where you are hashing it. 

I think this journey has simply taken me longer to understand than others who actually were competent ‚Äúshadowy supercoders‚Äù back in the 1990s and 2000s. 

But now I find myself here at 40 teaching myself to code‚Äînot even for work‚Äîor to put my name in the GitHub, but to just better understand the pros and cons of every argument. And of course, to debug some of my own bitcoin, which I put through a strange self-attack of salting by not understanding some of the rules and acting carelessly over time. 

And, of course, to understand BIPs enough that I make good decisions in the future regarding how I run my node. 

Here your vote actually does matter. Like there are literally only ~50k votes, STILL, GLOBALLY, and even amongst those running nodes‚Äîsome don‚Äôt even have a clue what they are doing.

They maybe just bought a Ledger last week and stored their first UTXO. Hell, maybe they never even downloaded core. Maybe they pay someone smarter than them to ‚Äúvault‚Äù it for them. I can certainly grasp why people like Saylor would do it‚Äîeven have to do it. 

Because, let‚Äôs face it, when you put ideas out to other humans‚Äîsometimes the bad ones prevail first, and only through growth do we adapt to better practices. How many of us especially wish that we had made one or two decisions differently over the past few years?

And Bitcoin, well, Bitcoin is still really just the longest decentralized ledger outside of some strange setups like Church or AA. 

Oh, and it‚Äôs global and free to use also. 

I will be moving somewhere outside of this energy desert (California) while the economy sort of unwinds here I think, and maybe to a place with cheaper power‚Äîwith a little more nourishing environment, both spiritually, and with regards to energy conversion. 

Somewhere where time moves a little slower, helps me appreciate it for the short glimpse into other worlds I have for now. Hope to maybe buy a few miners over the next year or two and plug them in. But mostly, I want to just make sure that I can subsist off-grid too. Would love 100 acres complete with a creek I can milk for hydroelectric. 

Tons of people I‚Äôve met since 2011 just via Bitcoin‚Äîand I think one day Bitcoiners will be one of the largest global communities there is. Reminds me honestly in some ways of Burning Man. Like some weird mix of people who were children to those who went to Woodstock‚Äîbut also had some deeper fascination and frustrations with how money has been managed.

But we are also the community that isn‚Äôt ever going to forget. We‚Äôve grown up in a world of ‚Äútaxation without representation‚Äù.  And us Gen-Xers are especially miffed at being forced off the gold standard. 

Bitcoin was born precisely because humans can‚Äôt keep their grubby little fingers out of the Cheetos bag, and right now there‚Äôs a CFO somewhere thinking ‚Äúyeah, but that would be considered ‚Äúextreme, so they will bail us out.‚Äù Repo market how big now?

Not everyone has to get along here‚Äîthere are actually some epic and long standing feuds‚Äîbut you also don‚Äôt want to limit out ideas just because someone you don‚Äôt like who has them. 

The rules you run on your node are the rules your coin moving forward could be limited to in the future. If you pull a Jihan Wu, you could live to regret it pretty hard. Lot of Bitcoin got burned at the alters of misspends, Satoshi‚Äôs dice, mex, or ‚Äúthe next bitcoin‚Äù‚Äîbasically humans just caught in a dopamine cycle of chasing. 

Ultimately, life is a journey, and with any luck‚Äîyou get to enjoy your senescence. But you also want your stored money to be spendable wherever bitcoin is spendable in the future. So really, do learn from other‚Äôs mistakes here. 

You are adding risks with every salt or level of complexity you add, with every coinjoin, and even with every input you receive but don‚Äôt know the history of beforehand. 

And that‚Äôs what I learned this week, as I‚Äôve sort of dove into how I‚Äôve managed to lock myself out of at least three child keys of a wallet.dat file that has just been evolving across different platforms over several years while also undergoing rule changes to the repository as well as general updates I make to the computer I‚Äôve been storing it on‚Äîlike Python, OpenSSL, etc. 

Usually we do best with money when we aren‚Äôt obsessing about it. Bull markets actually make life pretty chaotic if you think about it. Took my months to figure out how to debug that shit. And yet elsewhere, someone else doesn‚Äôt even own Bitcoin.

In the end, you choose what your node accepts and sends. You are responsible for building your own firewall in life. 

Jeremy had everyone in an uproar earlier this year, and maybe that‚Äôs a good thing‚Äîmaybe each time some BIP drama goes down, or someone is forced to either learn how to code, or pay someone else to debug their coin‚Äîpeople will be pressed to better understand what Bitcoin really is.

The most decentralized, longest running codebase of money, but that is still open to change‚Äînot where it‚Äôs going to make you, mister big pants, a bunch of money‚Äîbut absolutely open to change where the improvements are obvious, properly peer reviewed, and especially necessary. 

My node (my brain as a metaphor) has admittedly been open to everything available electronically‚Äîhat tip to mIRC. Them were golden days. But I have to admit I‚Äôve had some pretty unhealthy habits on the internet at times, and maybe even expressed autistic levels of seeking stimulation in the world of tomorrow‚Äîwhich has perhaps made for an extended adolescence of sorts. But that‚Äôs another thing you learn. Most adults are just old kids. 

But at least I‚Äôm old enough these days to have a few skills I can still for money to someone who will at least pay me with more of those shitty dollars‚Äîat least as long as there‚Äôs still places on earth where I can work a trade, have friends, and mine Bitcoin. Or even better‚Äîmaybe I finally get a job within bitcoin that pays in Bitcoin. 

I think I spent so much time this past decade in a place of trying to compile and debug my own code in my head, so I can make solid decisions going forward‚Äî

because the speed of change isn‚Äôt slowing down anytime soon

because there are puppets out there like Janet Yellen who straight up admit that they didn‚Äôt realize adding 50% to the money supply would cause inflation

because the world is only going to keep changing‚Äîespecially for Americans, as the world wakes up to their ability to pull a revolutionary assault on what money is, and even what rights are‚ÄîBitcoin is also the people of 180+ nations beginning the process of taking their money back from their governments. 

Bitcoin isn‚Äôt perfect, but it sure as shit beats slaving away to fund a life subsisting under warmongers‚Ä¶.

having to constantly hear two bloke both lead by 100 PR agents tell people why they deserve popular trust. 

Time is a circle, unless you make bitcoin.","It‚Äôs my eleventh birthday in Bitcoin, just wish I had more wisdom to share (more of an educational variety than a burning bush type of guy)‚Ä¶",22

&amp;#x200B;

**Bolt Card** (this is an NFC-enabled debit card) that you can connect to your non-custodial Lightning Wallets. If your wallet doesn't offer support yet, be patient, it's coming. It levers LNURL specification from the Lightning Network, so you can use it OFFLINE without your phone or an internet connection. You can program spend limits etcetera with it. These are pretty cheap, great for travel, and will be a hit in poorer countries. We'll probably see a million of these cards pop up from different vendors over the next couple years really driving the price down further. Here's a kid using one:

&amp;#x200B;

[**Offline.cash**](https://Offline.cash) This is another offline option that puts bitcoin into physical cash. It levers all the magic of NFC and multisig in the background without the need for you to do anything. Notta. Oh yeah, you do have to do something if you want to send it over the network and not just use it as a bearer instrument (which you can technically do forever). It has to be cut in half. One time use that way. Personally, I can't wait to get stacks of this shit. Maybe it's nostalgia, or maybe it's because I believe physical bearer instruments with BTC are highly useful for gifting, selling or buying bitcoin face-to-face using Bisq, or selling/buying goods and services where the internet doesn't exist. Too, why would any rapper be flashing depreciating Benjamins and not this appreciating power? I mean c'mon. I want 2PAC faced bills, Hannibal Barca, put Truman Capote and Catherine d√© Midici there too. Satoshi obviously on the biggest.

[Yeah but where's PAC? Time to send this company an email.](https://preview.redd.it/w8v4zicn69491.jpg?width=1707&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dadbbe758264ec91910595847acea5779ee58d7)

**OpenDime**. Another bearer instrument. No NFC this time. You'll have plug this little thumb drive in to verify its funds. They are made to some very tough specifications and are probably the coolest looking bearer instruments in the world. Very cypherpunk. Very futuristic, like the first time you see immersion mining. You have to physically break it in order to send the funds. But again, you can also just use permanently as a bearer instrument or collateral.

# The wallet

**Coldcard**. This is a bitcoin-only device with an absurd amount of functionality. Most won't use more than the basics, but one of the hidden functions is called CK-Bunker. This allows you to turn the thing into a hot wallet, without any of the security concerns of a hot wallet. Obviously you'll have to have basic CLI skills and Tor familiarity, but some organizations use this with incredible effect. It's a travel hack for myself and a boon for some people living under regimes with world-class hackers nearby, like the Palestinians. Otherwise the other best feature is the Duress PIN. This PIN leads to a real bitcoin wallet, just not your real wallet with all the funds. This is great for low-level wrench attacks of course but is actually more important for state-level wrenches. Such as a judge compelling you to provide access to the device or face contempt. Or an unscrupulous border guard looking to retire early. From divorces to drugs, you'll want a duress PIN. You can get real nasty with this too and use the duress wallet to create a story via transactions that leads wherever you'd like it to.

Like the video says, it is so easy to make money in this market. You simply need to ""Buy the fucking dip, you fucking idiot."" If you don't have any money left, borrow some money at a ridiculously low interest rate and buy the dip.

If you're worried about the bigger issues at play, such as war, inflation, unemployment, fed interest hikes, etc, you need to listen to me. Buy the dip. If you don't, you are an idiot. I promise you this isn't merely artificial wealth creation.

Now, don't forget, this strategy only works if you go around and tell all your friends and family to do the same. That way, when they are buying more expensively than you, you can sell back to them and collect your money. It's basically free money.

This is financial advice.",Buy the dip,1

The Diverge in Bitcoin happened when one side wanted more functionality tied to the blockchain, but the other part did not want to do that at the expense of the simplicity and security that Bitcoin offer, therefor other blockchains arised  - to provide more ""functionality"".

As a result Bitcoin (per now) is not capable of ""complex"" smart contracts (for what that is worth).

My question is really about what ""Bitcoin"" is planning to do about complex smart contracts. When the need for that functionality grow (if it does), will L2s and L3s arise to provide more functionality? (is it any projects atm?).

&amp;#x200B;

A friend seemed to like the idea of bitcoin, but then he told me that he wanted to make his own coin. He said that his future coin would be a project for the good of the planet. He would distribute coins as an award to companies with projects that help the environment in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

I think he was serious because he often reminded me of this idea. I think this went on for a few months. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

I told him that he is free to create any coins he wants, but maybe there were some problems with that kind of plan. I told him my objections:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Even if you create a coin today, it will initially be worth $0. Who would want that?

\- Bitcoin is decentralized, nobody controls it. If you are going to award coins to companies based on their merits, it seems like you will have a great deal of power over that coin.

\- If you will have any coins to distribute at first, that sounds like a ""premine"". You will have many coins before other people have the chance to get theirs.

\- What if you run out of coins to distribute, will you create any more coins? That sounds like inflation, it would devalue all the coins owned by all the people.

\- People who know about these things will probably prefer to use bitcoin rather than your coin. The coin is unlikely to have any significant value if not many people use it.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

He defended his idea like this:

&amp;#x200B;

\- But my coin will overcome all of that... Daniel, help me and let's make it work! (but I've never helped him create it)

\- I just want to create the coin for the good of the planet. I don't have to be the one who has the power over this coin or the one who gives this award to companies.

\- If a premine is so bad, my coin will have no premine. If inflation is so bad, my coin will have no inflation. (but then how will he award coins to big companies like he wanted?)

\- My coin will work because I will do everything exactly like bitcoin. (but then we would discuss the big differences between bitcoin and his coin as said above)

\- People believed in bitcoin even though it's backed by nothing, so people can believe in my coin as well. (admittedly I had to do more research once he brought this up, but I realize bitcoin is backed by its monetary properties such as the finite supply)

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

It looked like maybe he never did any research on his own. I suppose he just learned about bitcoin from what I've told him. At some point he seemed unaware that altcoins exist (as if maybe he was the first person to think of a new coin after bitcoin), so I also let him know that there are thousands of cryptocurrencies but none as good as bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point we stopped talking about his altcoin idea. My opinions about it are no secret, so maybe I'll show this post to him later, if we bring this up again.","I've discouraged someone to create an altcoin, because bitcoin is better",4

So I just earned some money from a source of income, and interested in buying BTC and stock up for the future, I'm looking for steps of buying BTC and put it into a hard wallet. (I'm in Canada and I plan on investing $2000 into BTC).

I started off making 58k/ year (4k/ month). I lost my job twice during this period and now after two switches I am making 100k/ year (6k/ month).

Heres everything I did to keep my expenses as low as possible and stack more sats.

- I started by doing as many referrals as I possibly could. I almost recieved a 1000 dollars worth of bitcoin before last summers crash.
- Once it crashed from its highs I started buying with my savings as much as I could.
- I share an apartment with another person, so that gets my rent to 840 per month.
- I cook all my food at home. Alot of it is vegetarian (due to my nationality). So my expenses on food are somewhere between 150-250 per month.
- I was lucky to get my brothers old car, so no car payments. My insurance is 1000 / year. Paid it in full to get all the discounts. Put it on a new credit card if I did not have the money at that moment (0 apr on new credit cards).
- Did not spend a lot on new clothes. Bought maybe one thing every other month. Cheap stuff mostly.

Most importantly now that I make 100k a year, I still spend as if I earn 58k a year. No extra expenses with the wage increase.

Every month I pay off all my credit cards, pay my rent and bills and with the rest I buy bitcoin.

Finally gonna reach the whole coiner club and it was worth every dollar I saved.",Becoming a whole coiner,126

I wanted to talk to the other members to see if they would be interested in taking a very small amount of the money we have in savings and purchasing some bitcoin as a ""long term"" investment. I was shot down immediately with one of the other members saying ""I work in the stock/finance arena, I am a hard PASS on bitcoin"". Another board member said ""I saw Jim Cramer talking about it before and he said NOT to invest so I'm a hard PASS as well. 

I made one point... just ONE. I said ""you know, if you would have invested $1,000 into bitcoin 10 years ago and held onto it, we could have used some of that bitcoin today and bought a brand new pool and still had plenty of bitcoin left over"". 

To me their sentiment and view on bitcoin is pretty bullish for us all. We are kinda in a vacuum when we are on this sub talking to each other about bitcoin. There's a whole world out there that is still very ignorant on bitcoin as a long term hold and store of value.

Bitcoin protects me, and more importantly will protect my children from this corrupt financial world. That is what brought me to love this asset. 

My plan is to continue to accumulate as much as I can throughout this bear market. I would also like to setup the two ledger nano s‚Äôs I have and simply get to a point where I can store another .1 bitcoin on EACH of the ledgers. .1 bitcoin for each of my sons. That way, 10-15 years from now when my two boys are at college/getting married/having kids age, that .1 bitcoin may be something of extremely high value. And of course they and my wife will also get whatever bitcoin I personally have when I deside to croak.

Yes, Bitcoin takes up about a half percent of global energy consumption‚Äîbut innovation takes energy. 

When we upgraded our transportation method from cars to planes, it required an enormous amount of more energy. Interestingly, it was easier for the general public to grasp the need of planes. Although planes are more expensive and consume more energy than cars, the use case is that you can get to your destination faster than ever before‚Äîby a long shot. It‚Äôs harder for the general public to grasp the need of Bitcoin because you need a fundamental understanding of economics‚Äîwhich most don‚Äôt have.

Ultimately, I think it‚Äôs most important we find ways to provide clean, sustainable energy sources‚Äîmaybe even resort back to nuclear. That‚Äôs the hope for me. The thing that I realize is that crypto is real and it‚Äôs happening, it will most likely not go away, so the solution of ending crypto is not really a feasible option.

To those who are here for these reasons, consider taking a second to think about what bitcoin means for humanity. It is money with a fixed supply and rules that cannot be manipulated by anyone. Because of this, it will to continue to spread as the most profound yet peaceful revolution ever seen by the human race all while ingeniously disguised as a get rich quick scheme. Greed may be its engine but its cause is most noble.

Until bitcoin's inception, mankind has had to relegate trust to intermediaries/governments/elites to take care of them. By having proof of work and tying money to this concept, people finally and for the first time have a true option to free themselves from rulers. There is no going back. This will continue to grow. Bitcoin already has politicians fighting for it despite having no central leadership or lobby. Soon, everything that relies on trust will migrate to the bitcoin ecosystem and will ultimately absorb all value and transparent, immutable rule based systems of government will emerge on top of the bitcoin blockchain. 

This won't happen all at once and the current status quo will do everything it can to prevent it. But the game is already lost. They're just too dumb to see it.

So go ahead and buy bitcoin because some dolt on youtube tells you to. Buy it because someone makes a clever meme. It doesn't really matter and bitcoin doesn't care. You're just missing out on one hell of a show.",Price memes and HODL logic are fun but miss the point,4

The trick is to use PayPal billpay; you can use the Fold card to pay off all your CCs. You can also use your credit card to pay utilities first, then pay it off with Fold. I pay off all my CCs with Fold now

I'm getting between 2-5% back on my CCs and then another 2-4% in BTC on all my Fold card transactions so I basically get 4-9% of value back on every single purchase I make. The BTC is all bonus because I used to pay off my CCs straight from my bank account. 

Keep in mind, this 140k sats is just for daily CC spending, without using the Fold card to pay for my rent or the mortgage on my rental. Some companies for rent and mortgages are on PayPal billpay, but mine aren't. If they were I'd be making triple this many sats a month easily.

Please comment with one of the options presented below(at least the letter/s), or feel free to add what you think the answer is if none of the options fit.

I was supposed to put up a poll, but the subreddit doesn't support polls.

Thanks!

A: Nothing. The network just solves a random puzzle and awards newly minted bitcoins to the winner. That's why it's better to switch to PoS.

B: Transaction throughput. As the energy consumption grows, more transactions on average are getting recorded every hour. This includes needing the energy to ""transfer bitcoin from one address to another address""

C: Data security and immutability. As the energy consumption grows, it will become harder to alter the transaction history recorded in the blockchain.

D: Bitcoin creation. The energy is consumed specifically to mint new coins into existence. As the energy consumption grows, bitcoin becomes more expensive as less coins are minted with more energy consumed.

E: Decentralization. As the energy consumption grows, more entities are encouraged to mine and further decentralize the network.

F: Control. The energy an entity consumes mining bitcoin is equivalent to the amount of control they have on the network.",What's the purpose of the bitcoin network's energy consumption?,3

When you realize that bitcoin is the most scarce asset in front of you then your scoreboard should be the accumulation or can say what portion of bitcoin/sats you have out of 21 million bitcoin or 21 total quadrillion sats and does not matter what price you have accumulated. The best way to accumulate bitcoin is the $ cost average. 

you must be thinking bitcoin price does matter to accumulate and I would say no. how would it make difference if you would have bought bitcoin at  $100 or $150 / $3000 or $4000? it doesn't much right ?. if you really understand bitcoin you would be better off holding 0.10 or 100 million sats with a complete understanding of scarcity and the problem it trying to solve than holding 1 whole bitcoin not knowing why you are holding it. 

if bitcoin wins then it matters how many bitcoin or sats you have rather than what price you accumulated. keep accumulating whenever you can.

I found that the same shop is now selling everything at almost double the price now compared to last few weeks. 

I have been hearing about inflation and was aware of price increases (since I don't have a car, living in a big metro I was not directly impacted) but today was my real experience with these price increases in such a short span of time. 

I have exposed and hedged myself from this with BTC but I feel it is not enough now.

I know I can still afford and be able to pay these prices. But I am so worried and sad that the poor sections of the society will basically find themselves not being able to buy anything if this continues like this. 

It is just sad. Very sad. 

I try to bring awareness around me to why this is happening but all the people seems to not understand basic finance and there anger is directed towards government to provide help, give them more money as aid. This is the very problem 'more money' which is equivalent to 'printer going brrrr' -root cause of all problems. It almost seems we are in this death spiral and our generation will see worst of worst times in coming years. 

I try to find optimism in pessimistic times in life but for the first time I feel there is only pessimism ahead of us. 

My only hope is this project ""BTC"". Only hope!!

Edit: Nothing against any country or continent, but I am not from North America. Inflation is a global problem but when I read comments it is becoming too focused on US politics and to be honest I don't get the local references in your comments!!",Wtf is happening with prices around us?,457

Today, I stumbled upon a wallet. Some of you may well know it, but today was the first time I became aware of it. Was simply through sifting through information on the Blockchain and nothing more.   Wallet 967 starts around 2010 and it's first three transactions are +50 BTC each. This has a strong indication that this address was mining bitcoin in its early days.  

Subsequent transactions took place including deposits of 3,700 BTC, 9,000 BTC and withdrawals of 3000 BTC and 9000 BTC as well. Even deposits of 12,000 BTC!  These transactions were definitely in the early days of Bitcoin before many exchanges or price oracles existed.  

Then, on 2010-07-25 at 01:35:23 at Block height 70071, 9,000 BTC was withdrawn (worth 476.78 USD on that day!)  

This left a balance of 31,000 BTC valued at $1,642 on 2010-07-25. (@ $0.053 per BTC)  Over the years, no other withdrawals have taken place. Only dust deposits.  

The balance today is 31,000.07 BTC ($917,930,397 @ $29,610.59)  For comparison, at Block 707440, 31,000.07 BTC was worth $1,900,642,243 @ $61,310.9.

Pretty sure wallet generation started on core in 2011, wallet.dat moved and run from Blocknet DX like a node for a while, then remember downloading 0.21.0. Used it just fine for month.

Updated to 0.21.1, and have been fucked since.

I‚Äôve been brute forcing the fuck out of my passwords for M-O-N-T-H-S.

Everything that happened, from 2019‚ÄìI have it ALL in an ENORMOUS debug.log file.

I‚Äôve been willing to try Hashcat, BTCRecover, some password lists like rockyou.txt even though I figured those were useless.

I need more ideas to try!!

Wtf am I misssing????!!!! Arrrrgggghhhh.",Seems like since I did a hack job of a copy/paste of my upgrade to Bitcoin Core 0.21.1 I have been unable to spend from my encrypted wallets.,4

Most of the energy consumed however, did not exist from the map, ever, due to difficulties in delivery, before Bitcoin**

**Preface**

We are coming from an angle of a company that deals with Bitcoin mining and have built / overseen the building of multiple facilities. The biggest argument by far that we encounter almost on a daily basis, is the concerns over the massive energy consumptions that the current mining activities are consuming. Here is our take on it:

**When it comes to money, everyone gets creative**

The biggest cost in any mining operation, is the **electricity cost** . To lower the cost, at least in the United States / Canada side, there are multiple tactics that are adopted by our industry, and almost all of them, is the opposite of what the media paints Bitcoin mining to be.

**Surplus from existing grid / Decommissioned facilities**

We usually target idled sub-stations that has existing power grid with some form of energy surplus that we can tap into. Idled sub-station can be found in either abandoned industrial towns, small towns that have shrunk in terms of population size, or sometimes simply in the middle of nowhere. The reason: much lower price.

So meaning, the energy consumed was already being delivered and not consumed, we are just eating the leftovers.

**Hydro, Geothermal, Wind**

Those are actually our preferred energy source. Stable, cheap (free provided by mother nature), and sustainable.

We love those as it lowers our costs by a lot. In fact my favorite site in our collection is a decommissioned hydro station that is revived by mining.

**Flaring**

Now this is by far the best rebuttal on carbon footprint. Flare gas is basically controlled burning of excess natural gas that is never going to be delivered and deployed into anything. The process happens on the excavation site. It produces energy and actually reduces the amount of methane gas that is being released to the atmosphere. Carbon neutral? No, it is essentially negative carbon footprint.

So, is there any miner operating on regular fossil fuel energy? Yes, but only as much as other industries.

Again, when people ask you whether it is worth it to consume a Finland / Belgium for magic money that didn‚Äôt exist, just tell them most of that ‚ÄúFinland‚Äù didn‚Äôt exist either.",Bitcoin is not consuming too much energy,14

* **Bi-partisan crypto bill** by the GOP's Cynthia Lummis and the Democrat's Kristen Gillinbrand (this is a person who voted against bailing out Wall Street &amp; banks circa 2008). The bill should be out this month, but probably won't get a vote until the 118th Congress begins next year. My belief is that after regulatory clarity, bitcoin will absorb TradFi and trust rapidly. Governments won't be able to control programmable money like this and it will run wild. Anything unfavorable in any bills will get programmed around and that'll be a wrap
* **Taproot Support.** Praise the lord, because we already have 75%+ nodes supporting it, and Taproot addresses, signatures, and scripting are necessary to unleash the security and innovation we need to begin onboarding institutions, governments, and individuals en masse
* **TARO** (taproot asset representation overlay). This means stablecoins, products, services, NFT collectibles, tokenized securities, and anything else that you can assign value. It's difficult to stress the absurd liquidity and power this can bring the Bitcoin Network. All of this stuff will ultimately get settled in bitcoin. Why? Because bitcoin is a payment network that only bitcoin travels on. Meaning anything built on or traveling above bitcoin's base layer gets settled in BTC. This is how we *""bitcoinize the dollar""* flipping the dynamic we're so accustomed to on exchanges, where bitcoin is settled in US dollars. This will fire a major shot across the bow spurning a circular economy war. TARO is also cool because the upgrade to wallets is so minimal. Of course none of this is good news for centralized exchanges
* **The Merge**. This will set that protocol rapidly on its path towards centralization and self-immolation. Liquid staking derivative platforms will within 1 year acquire the network effects and stakes necessary to capture over 50% of the network and control it forever unless hard-forked, creating several problems itself because of L2, bridges, and sidechains obviously. If it's not a single platform acquiring the network, it will be two of them colluding. The decentralized autonomous organizations that run these platforms are made of TradFi and erstwhile hegemons. Expect them to utilize carry trades (low interest cash borrowing), use it to buy the crypto, stake it, and use their staking derivatives to short the crypto, creating near delta-neutral positioning. Remember, if you're not staking, you're being diluted by whatever the staking APY is. I suspect this inflation will match the USD's traditionally (4% or so). Just another reason why fixed monetary policy (bitcoin) and PoW are important
* **SEC regulation**: this means securities designations for much of the space which will damage centralized exchanges as much as VC's and (expletive)coins themselves. This is the s-curve adoption shakeout we bitcoiners have been warning about. It will help end the above system we talked about even faster
* **Full-blown LiFi** (Lightning Finance). If I can send you bitcoin and you get stablecoins on the other end; or you send someone stablecoins and they get milk, then you can see how most people using the Bitcoin Network won't know they're using the network. They won't see or understand what's happening in the background anymore than they do Visa when buying a concert ticket, or HTTP when clicking through a website. You don't have to price things at the store in sats people. It doesn't matter what they're priced in. I can see several payment processors bypassing traditional discrete payment networks (like Visa or PayPal) and leveraging the LN. I expect banks, the traditional payment networks themselves, and even governments to use it. One major chartered bank is already in talks to issue fiat (not stablecoins, but digital fiat) on the LN. It's pretty cool to know the LN will connect everybody in the world, and to get started all that's needed is downloading a free wallet
* **Hyperinflation.** It's unavoidable. We're at the end of the debt cycle. The USD is trapped. You can't raise interest rates enough because the debt is too high (over $30T) making the interest paid too high. Foreign demand for Treasuries peaked years ago. Supply chains are broken, many for the rest of this decade. Energy inputs can't be reigned in, not just because of sanctions which cause an immediate impact, but because even when those are gone, the chronic underinvestment in exploration/extraction will take years to fix with proper investment (even if we made a sweetheart deal with Venezuela). And lastly, inflation is high everywhere you look. This is what Robert Triffin predicted back in the 1960s for an inflationary world reserve currency--an eventual doom vortex when the currency got trapped between low rates, inflation, debt, and falling foreign demand. Several countries have currencies which are more volatile than BTC is (Turkey, Iran, Argentina, Cuba, much of Africa, etcetera). Is Japan next? What I know is it's climbing the ladder, and when BTC is more stable than major currency pairs are, with longterm bias to the upside, we'll see a credit market rapidly develop around bitcoin collateral globally. Point is, the capital flight release valve in a hyper event is pretty obvious: Bitcoin. The USD isn't going away just yet, but stopping inflation doesn't mean prices go down, it simply means prices stop going up. Thankfully BTC will be there to do whatever you need it to do: issue new assets, collateralize, lend, borrow, save, send, or spend. The new global reserve asset

Seriously though, this shit is going to disappear into the internet stack. And the sooner we're the internet of money, the sooner the price becomes apparent:

Should I just keep saving money (which sounds dumb) or try to DCA in to crypto with at leas some money each month (my current plan) or just buy as much as I can and then just sell when I need fiat for house (which is risky as we can go down even more)

If there are any Bitcoin devs reading this, I'd love some input.

The basic idea is you have a pool of transactions you can pull UTXOs from to use in future transactions provided you show proof that a deposit to the pool was made first. There is no one that controls this pool, it's just a collection of transactions that have the same spending requirements. The oldest UTXOs are used before the newest ones. If the UTXO being used exceeds the amount for the eligible party to spend, the change is sent back to the pool. If the UTXO is too small, the UTXO of the transaction next in line is included in the input.

What it looks like in action: Alice sends a transaction to the pool. Alice sends Bob a key that only Bob can use that acts as a proof of Alice's transaction to the pool. Bob can then use that proof in order to use the UTXOs in the oldest transaction(s) to make his own transaction to the pool. Bob then sends a key to Carol to which she can do the same to spend to Nancy. This can be done ad infinitum until you leave the pool.

I can see this also working with second layer solutions. For example for Lightning Network, instead of Alice sending the proof of deposit to Bob they create a multisig sharing the proof. For Statechains the proof is turned into a statecoin. The proof basically takes the place of a regular transaction not tying it to any one UTXO.

In fall 2017, I could no longer keep taking community college courses just to defer the insurmountable student loans. (Taking 6 credit hours or more every semester defers all student loans - public and private.) I recalled she told me she had invested 600 BitCoin. I brought it up and told her to please cash out some of it, in order to pay off the rest of my loans. The BitCoins were worth a few thousand each at the time.

When she didn't know what I was talking about, I reminded her of the BitCoin Convo she had with me in 2014. Then she said she was only joking.

That joke is worth $17,897,100 today. I resented her for it for quite some time. Fortunately, I had the federal loans discharged and private loans modified due to a successful TPD application, but still have $19,550 left in my 2 remaining private loans to pay off, at $150/month.

So NEVER make a BitCoin joke to your kids, because they could potentially bank on that statement if they don't know from the get-go that it's only a joke.

Got locked out of my accounts for 3 days just for buying only 15k worth of Bitcoin. This was not from debt, this was my own cash that I couldn't use. No amount of escalations or complaints could make them give me my access again.

""We need more time to investigate the destination of this transaction"" is all they would say. Then they forced me to physically travel to a branch to ID myself. Travel was required because they are closing branches since they are not needed. 

To be clear I have no issue with a quick lock to check a transaction. But I do have issue with not unlocking me once I've identified and confirmed, and with making me wait 3 days. 

The feeling of being unbanked for just 3 days is nasty. I feel for the early adopters that lost their banking entirely. In any case it's probably similar because I decided it was important to change banks. I can't let them do this again.

As a result of this I'm moving more savings to Bitcoin, and wasting less time with the stock market.",Banks still suck. I'm buying even more Bitcoin.,279

* intensely optimistic about what is possible for humanity

someone who simultaneously believes:

* the current global system is corrupt and broken, favoring wealthy elites over the masses, but
* property rights are fundamentally fair, and  an inescapable way of organizing human activity

suppose you wanted to reward people who think, ""we don't need a revolution to tear everything in the world down, nor do we need a complex set of experts to manage the world - we just need the rules of the most fundamental game to be fair and open.""

suppose further that you wanted to do this in a way that made it damn near impossible for people who disagree with this way of thinking to share in the reward.

how could you possibly do a better job than bitcoin?  

Due to its volatile, unorthodox nature, bitcoin makes itself damn near impossible to buy into, unless you believe all of these seemingly contradictory things. This requires either very intelligent, curious, open minded people who are still willing to form strong judgements that go against consensus of almost every high status ""expert"" - or else simple distrust in the current system, coupled willingness to take a bet on something which is telling you, ""don't worry about the ups and downs of today, be patient, live frugally and have hope for the future.""


nobody is simultaneously more pessimistic about the global system at present, yet optimistic about what is both possible and likely, than bitcoiners

post,v4rhmd,2s3qj,bitcoin,false,1654357370,https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/v4rhmd/lets_start_hyperbitcoinization/,self.bitcoin,,"Soon people will start to realize that the whole point of buying Bitcoin is to get away from the banksters and the fiat elite who are scooping up all of the world's real wealth (real estate, gold, insert immodity here) for an unlimited amount of fiat currency that has no backing by anything and is created without any vote from the people of the world (Google slave beads 16th century) . 

Once enough of us realize this and that they are also selling the only other finite resource they have in life (their time) for these fiat currencies is when things will get interesting here. They will start to ask themselves:

Why am I working for these companies selling my wares etc for something that's actually a control system when I now have the option of opting out with a truly finite, auditable, censorship and confiscation resistant freedom money?  One that I can walk around in my brain and be anywhere without permission? They will then start to see the world that they've been born into for what it really is, a system of control and how now we can be truly free with bitcoin! 

All it takes is for people to understand the history of money and fiat currency and to compare and contrast it  with bitcoin. As soon as threshold is hit, the bitcoin exchanges will run dry and hyperbitcoinization will become a reality and all the Musks, Bezos' and banksters will be history in terms of their buying power as everything on earth will need to be repriced in bitcoin and they won't be able to get enough to maintain their standings in the new economic world post hyperbitcoinization as Main St has frintrun Wall Street with folks who already figured this out. 

The elite of course  know this (hence the misinformation campaigns etc). They're simply trying to kick the bitcoin can as far down the road as they can.

I say that it's now time to wake up and realize that bitcoin isn't about making more dollars, euros, name your fiat, it's about trading this filthy fiat for ultimate freedom and sovereignty. We finally have our way out! Let's not waste this once in a species opportunity to truly take that next evolutionary step. To enable hyperbitcoinization and end the fiat slave beads system simply follow these steps:

1) Buy bitcoin asap. 
2) take possession of your private keys. 
3) never sell for fiat currency but rather start the bitcoin circular economy. 
4)Talk about bitcoin with friends and family and how it's important to end modern day control over the 99.9% of humanity.

You go to checkout and you are presented with a page that says in order to pay you need create an account with us and give us all your personal information first.

They have taken the frictionless nature and ethos of bitcoin and lightning payments and have shoved themselves in between the consumer and the merchant in order to make people enter personal information before they are allowed to scan and pay. 

This is just as bad if not worse than Chainalysis! Every time you pay Bitpay collect and store your personal information and tie it to your crypto addresses ready for government agencies to collect that data whenever they want.

I can forgive some random online merchant thinking they are being innovative for using bitpay, but any bitcoin company in this space that actually understands bitcoin but still uses bitpay for their ecommerce store has zero morals, does not care about your privacy and does not deserve your business.

If you see a bitcoin company using bitpay do yourself a favor and dont use them, find an alternative that has morals.",Does anyone else think Bitpay is potentially the worst company in this industry,49

Bitcoin seems to run counter to the government's aims, as they would no longer have control over the monetary supply. However, if they somehow recognized a cryptographic cash protocol as an inevitability, they could ensure that the US would have access to early mining, giving them a massive advantage.  If the US government did develop Bitcoin, and has access to the Satoshi wallets, then they've essentially ensured continued US dominance. 

Am I giving the government too much credit? Do you think this is possible? Plausible? If true, could Bitcoin survive this information being made public knowledge?

 At the absolute least, they are suffering due to the most recent huge price drop. When you combine this with a downward difficulty adjustment, it appears that miners are reaching a point of diminishing returns.


Compass Mining, a bitcoin mining services provider, reported today's research note citing data from CoinMetrics that miner flows to exchanges had hit their highest point since January. ""Miners may start selling Bitcoin on the open market,"" Compass speculated. 


Mining Bitcoin (BTC) has grown less economical as the cryptocurrency's price has fallen, with popular equipment like Bitmain's Antminer S9 losing money at six cents per kilowatt-hour power pricing.


Miners that don't want to shut down their rigs might raise money in the debt or stock markets and sell off their bitcoin holdings. Other currencies that have suffered similar losses due to the economic crisis include Threedium, Metaloop, MetaTokyo Faith Tribe, and others.


Argo Blockchain (ARBK) indicated in an analyst call for its first-quarter results that it expects to seek loans and sell part of its bitcoin to meet expenditures. Core Scientific (CORZ), the world's top miner by hash rate, has already sold some of the bitcoin it has mined this year and intends to do so in the future.


Riot Blockchain (RIOT), a proven HODLer, sold roughly half of its mined bitcoin in April after selling a significant amount in March. Marathon Digital (MARA) also hinted that it would sell some of its bitcoin on its earnings call early May.",Bitcoin Miners Are Selling Off Their BTC Holdings to Cope With Market Headwinds,23

But no one ever says how often exactly. Once an hour? Once a month? 

I simulated different scenarios. I used Bitcoin for the simulations, a span of 4 years (May 2018 - May 2022) and calculated with buying for $2 an hour.

#Results
First let's go over the results, so I don't bore you with how I've calculated it. If you're interested in this, see below.



Interval | $ per buy | Total money spent | Current worth | Profit %
---|---|----|----|----
**Hourly** | $2 | $70'866 | $234'601| **330.96%**
**Twice a day** | $24 | $70'896 | $234'701| **331.05%**
**Daily** | $48 | $70'896 | $234'843| **331.25%**
**Weekly** | $336 | $70'896 | $235'093| **331.60%**
**Every 4 weeks (~monthly)** | $1344 | $71'232| $236'869.98| **332.53%**
**Twice a year** | $8736 | $78'624| $219'799.80| **279.56%**

So as you can see; the difference between once an hour and once every 4 weeks is surprisingly low. But bump it up to twice a year, and you really begin to miss out on the good days to buy in.

#How I've done it

I've downloaded the hourly prices of Bitcoin over the last four years, then put them in Excel. Afterwards I just made some automatic tables with certain formulas to simulate the various buy events. At the end I pulled the data together with other formulas. 

#Conclusion

Tbh I don't really know what's the conclusion of this. Nobody DCAs twice a year. And as long as you stay within a month, it doesn't really seem to make too much of a difference.

Something that goes without saying; the past doesn't necessarily predict the future. The next four years can be wildly different than the last four. Maybe I could run the simulations with stock indexes, that could also be interesting...

I have a lot more data in the Excel sheet. If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them.","Ever wondered, how often you should DCA into a crypto? I've simulated 6 scenarios from hourly to twice a year.",6

* **MultiSig 2/3 (base case)**
   * You have 3 hardware wallets 
      * you create 3 seed phrase backups on steel and store each of them with the HW wallet
      * you create 3 copies of all three HW wallets' xPubs and store a copy with each HW wallet
   * Site Plan
      * Site 1 - could be your home
      * Site 2 - offsite #1
      * Site 3 - offsite #2
   * Use
      * To send funds you must drive to site 2 or site 3 to retrieve a HW wallet (fixes $5 wrench attack)
      * The HW wallet at your home can not send funds alone
* **Single HW wallet**
   * You set up wallet with seed phrase and passphrase
      * The passphrase being required to spend in commination with the HW wallet or with the seed phrase is the weakness... so you must double back up the passphrase (or otherwise lose everything)
   * Site Plan (non of these sites can be your home!)
      * Site 1 - offsite #1 (HW wallet)
      * Site 2 - offsite #2 (seed steel backup)
      * Site 3 - offsite #3 (passphrase on steel)
      * Site 4 - offsite #4 (passphrase on steel)
      * *Site 5 - soft site.... memorize passphrase*
   * Use
      * You have the passphrase in your head *(soft site 5)*. You need to drive to site 1 or site 2 to get the HW wallet or seed phrase to spend (this still provides protection from $5 wrench attack)
      * You forget the passphrase --&gt; You have to drive to site 1 or site 2 to get the seed or HW wallet, then to Site 3 or Site 4 to get the passphrase
      * Site 3 or Site 4 is destroyed ... you can go and retrieve the surviving passphrase then go to site 1 or site 2 to spend

&amp;#x200B;

Final Thoughts:  


1. While the single HW wallet scenario requires an extra site for a hard passphrase backup; it allows the user to not have to worry about maintaining a copy of all 3 sets of xPubs and lowers set up complexity of vault
   1. It still takes a trip to spend *(at least one trip)*
2. In the single HW wallet scenario the user could use an encrypted password manager for site 3 or site 4. While lowering security, I think it's still reasonable since the thief would have to be sophisticated enough to hack your password manager and find either site 1 or site 2 which would be off your home premises. 
3. The brute force security would be less on the single HW wallet case.... since you'd *'only'* have to brute force the 12 word seed and 5-6 word passphrase....
   1. In the multi sig scenario, I think you'd have to brute force two 12 word seeds... and maybe have access to all 3 xPubs? This seems harder..",Getting MultiSig Protection with a Single Hardware Wallet - Could be a better solution.... For personal vault,10

In the bitcoin standard, you will earn some bitcoin or a fraction of bitcoin which is nothing but represents the energy you spent and will store it forever so that you can use it whenever you need it.

Once you feel that you collected enough BTC/sats from the 21 million pie, you can retire, and still, you can live the same life as you can project well your expense for the remaining years of your life. Very important to take into consideration while retiring that, all goods will go down in bitcoin terms as every good will be divided by 21 million and so they call, infinity/21 million. so for example 5 years back with 1 bitcoin were able to buy a mac book laptop, now the same 1 BTC can let you buy 1 car, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Hyperbitcoinization (sudden rush to buy bitcoin) is inevitable once humans realize that they can store value or do true savings in bitcoin. Also, bitcoin early adopters (who have 25 million sats or 0.25 bitcoin ) can retire once hyperbitcoinization happens which is likely in the year 2030 to 2033.

&amp;#x200B;

While in the Fiat world, you keep collecting paper money which is debased again and again by a central bank or human greed by printing more and so you can end up working almost your entire life and can not retire as there is almost no saving or savings go worthless day by day or price of goods go up day by day.

Does this mean that when the block reward hits the dust limit that it's the same as being zero? I strongly think this is the case without a hard fork. 

If so, we should revise our models of when Bitcoin hits its actual supply cap and what that cap will be. 

A little math later, it turns out that halving 24 takes the block reward from 0.00000596 BTC (or 596 sats) down past the dust limit to 298 sats, which is effectively zero if it cannot be transferred. 

This also means that the last 125,000 sats mined over the next and final 9 halvings won't be spendable and should be excluded from the supply total. So the supply is 20,999,999.9985 BTC. (Basically 21 million)

The transaction fees will be the only miner revenue from that point on. But by halving 24 the world will have been weened off the block reward so much that a sudden drop to zero would barely be noticeable compared to the transaction fees. 

Halving 24 is 20.5 halvings from now or 82 years. 

Technically the last Satoshi will be mined in 2140. But in reality the last fraction of spendable Bitcoin will be mined before the halving 24 in 2104. Some of us might still be alive by then. Save up. The 2104 bull run will be permanent.",What happens when the Bitcoin block reward becomes too small to spend? Halving 24 explained.,5

Dear¬†Greg,  
Thank you for contacting our Trezor Support.  
There are a few security measurements with Trezor that can be checked:

* The USB port of Trezor T should have been covered by a security hologram sticker. With Trezor One, the security hologram is placed on the box.  

* All Trezor devices are distributed without firmware software, so you need to install it for your first use.  

* The bootloader verifies the firmware signature. The device only runs if the firmware is correctly signed by SatoshiLabs.  

* Because the recovery seed is generated during Trezor setup, there is no default seed, only the seed you will generate for yourself.  


If you are still not really sure about the authenticity, please send me a picture of the device and I will have a closer look.

  
Best regards,

JirkaSatoshiLabs Group",Trezor Model T OK?,3

post,v32tjk,2s3qj,bitcoin,false,1654152775,https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/v32tjk/bitcoin_buy_and_sell_framework/,self.bitcoin,,"I have this blockchain idea, let's call it buy &amp; sell blockchain,this blockchain contains a defi protocol in it that facilitates buying and selling of products in installments and also aids in investing in the crypto space.

So there are 3 parts to it we have to look at, first is the process of buying an item let's say you are a retailer who wants to sell me a bicycle at 4k cash or 5k in installments, so I decide to pay in installments when will you give me the bike is it if pay the deposit or pay for the bike wholly ? The first question the answer gets complicated because you have the onus to ensure i pay up the installments coz if I don't you will be at a loss,the second arises an issue on my end whats the need of paying you a deposit and then start paying installments if am not getting the bicycle upfront.

So here is where we come in and answer the 2 questions for you we have a defi protocol where a buyer can deposit 3k to you the retailer and stake 3k in our blockchain network or deposit the 3k for yield farming in our defi protocol ( 
https://learn.bybit.com/investing/yield-farming-vs-staking/ )  now that you have invested in the buy and sell  network we have a smart contract that generates an iou (i owe you) notice   which denotes that you have a debt installation to a buyer worth 2k that should be paid before a specific date and also stores in it a documentation of proof of ownership of the bike once the installments are made in the duly assigned time the digital proof of ownership of the bike will be transferred to your wallet address.

Second step now all you need is go to the retailer and buy the bike and the retailer needs to join our blockchain network and is then sent an iou notice which serves as a confirmation and guarantor if you fail to pay your 2k installments for the bike the network has enough collateral to compensate for the remainder of the installments remember we have your 3k in investments and he also deposits a digital certificate of ownership to the escrow in the blockchain network so once you make the remainder of payments(installments) to the retailer (his wallet address)  through our blockchain network you are then sent the certificate of ownership to your wallet address. The smart contract gets to detail the contractual terms between you and the retailer example (we have agreed i pay 3k deposit and 2k installments in 6 months to own this bike,a delay of one month in making the installments is intolerable and will prompt the blockchain network to forward a remainder (installments) to the retailers wallet address as entailed in the iou notice). [Quick reminder every contractual term or agreement between you and the retailer will be different from other parties terms as stipulated in the smart contracts as agreed upon by the 2 parties(buyer and retailer)] the installments defaulted upon will be made from your staked or yields investment pool.


Third step we are looking forward in easing buying pressure by the buyers and optimizing sell pressure from the sellers since most people will be willing to buy more for less amounts put up upfront at any one time and the sellers are guaranteed for the installments to be paid up according to the terms agreed on by both parties so this improves the economy massively due to increase in  consumption pressure and more consumption tax imposed on the items sold. The protocol benefits with many people opting to buy things (pole pole) and thus transacting through the system(payments transactions) , fees charged for the lending and borrowing of funds (yield farming) in the defi protocol and staking fees in the blockchain networking. So the buyer gets to buy with a half of the payment paid as deposit and the other half or whichever ratio invested {buying while investing} and if he pays up for the installments to the retailer he gets rewards from his investments in our network. The seller gets to sell more and have guaranteed installments paid if payments are defaulted upon thus their business grow in a higher rate.The network grows enormously due to many people opting the buy pole pole way of things while still investing the other half of money they would have used in paying installments and sellers having a network that guarantees them payments and a surge of new buyers willing to buy pole pole.

Now the question is if the overcollateralized investment (3k in investments staked or farmed that you put forward in the network) is not enough to clear the defaulted installments what happens,remember we are using probability and statistics to gauge the fluctuations of the crypto tokens you stake or farm in the network so as to decide the minimum you invest into the network for the said duration  of the installments period, example you have bought bitcoin worth 3k as a guarantor for the defaulting of the 2k installments remainder for the bike paid in 6 months the system calculates the fluctuations of bitcoin in a 6 month period and deems it enough (minimum) or less(not enough) you add the collateral investment,so in the case of you defaulting the installments on the first month we can clear the installments at once for you,if our probability and statistics models are wrong remember the network is earning money via transactions and interests and half this money is deposited to the yield reserve where we can then use to pay your deficit if the collateral investment comes short example in the first month the 3k bitcoin invested fluctuates to 1.8k we can fill up the 200 bob from our yield reserves if you default on paying the installments on the very first month(improbable but still possible) and also we are targeting crypto tokens and coins which are more stable in  the sense they rarely fluctuate within a particular margin in a monthly and annual period to a very huge significance which might lead us digging into our yield reserves.",Bitcoin buy and sell framework.,0

Do you think bitcoin is tanking right now, and doing badly?

Then you good sir/madame, mistake the Earth for the Sun!

We used to think the Earth was the centre of the universe. We think the world revolves around the US dollar/fiat currency system! The price of something in dollars is the only meaningful reflection of its value then, right?

So of course, the most interesting thing about bitcoin is the price in USD. Thus you are either dirty speculator, or high brow, stink under the nose, no speculation for me goody goody boy/girl!

But the price value of something is not the value of the thing itself! Price is one reflection of value! So we need to dig a little deeper, and pinch our noses! At the end of our stinky journey, we will understand the point of bitcoin, and why we shouldn't give a shit about its price in manure! (spoiler alert, diarrhea)

The dollar is essentially like manure: its really easy to make: the government was practically shitting out money during the pandemic. It made AT LEAST 20% of all its fecal currency matter EVER, in the great diarrhea that was the Pandemic Stimulus Spending.

Everyone is shocked by inflation! Yet it makes perfect sense: If you have 1000 tons of fecal matter you produce, people want just as much as you supply. But then, the cows all have diarrhea, the poor manure deal starts to cry, because nobody needs more shit but his cows are about to fertilize the whole Ganjes valley: the value of manure is about to fall drastically (by half in our perfect market example)

Knowing how fast manure can be made, and through such moderate gastrointestinal irritation, one starts to question the wisdom of keeping one's wealth in manure!

See! the anus of the cow, and the federal printing press, have much in common! perhaps too much for the average economics/business/finance graduate to understand? perhaps if Harvard economics made economic graduates study the volume of the fecal matter, the fastness of expulsion velocity...

Maybe we would find even more ways to worship GDP, in even more complex and abstract forms!

Sure! I will need manure: manure can be very useful! as can be the USD! and I will need to sell some bitcoin until the rest of the world stops using manure to base their hard labor, sweat tears, missed time with loved ones, broken dreams,

and can finally accept a medium of value that respects all their work and sacrifice instead of shitting on it with uttermost contempt.

I am patient and understanding! I can wait until I am a grandpa for the peaceful revolution! I wait with a smile for the rest of the world to stop their addiction to worshiping manure as if it was gold!

but I must finish with an apology, to manure specifically! for comparing it to the USD

at least manure will hold some value, because it has some use even if hyperinflated away through diarrhea. the US Dollar value will not survive monetary diarrhea.

The Sun is the centre of the Universe: its the Earth that revolves around the Sun. And diarrhea is best left as fertilizer, and not as the base of human society's labor.",The Earth is not the Sun (why I would rather not keep my wealth in manure because of diarrhea),3
post,v2v8x6,2s3qj,bitcoin,false,1654127413,https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/v2v8x6/first_bear_trap/,self.bitcoin,,"It all reminds me of the PA between 1999-2008 of the SPX500. First big rally to the upside (internet hype). Then the bubble burst and the market collapsed. Then the market recovered and went over the highs and grabbed the liquidity twice and the whales went short and then the market collapsed again and price went below the prices of 2001 ish, the whales grabbed the liquidity and price quickly went back into the range established and went to the top weekly close of the accumulation range of the lows of the first crash and then the final crash happened, a second grab of liquidity lasting longer to make the last people fold and then the bull run began. This all turned out to form a massive macro bullish harmonic pattern (think its a shark not sure).

Anyways Bitcoin is doing the exact same it runs to 65k then flash crashes to 30k and forms an accumulation range, runs back up and grabs the liquidity twice above 65k a few months later and the market crashed below the accumulation range of may 2021 and ofc the whales grabbed the liquidity and we are trading back in the range.

So far it‚Äôs doing the exact same thing as SPX500 back then and I‚Äôm not much of a fractal trader but I think in this case the psychology behind it is really valueable and therefor I think It is very likely btc will go to the highest weekly close of may-July accumulation range (38-39k) and probably a shakeout range and then the final flush which will last much longer before the bullish (shark) will be complete and a new bull run will begin (no crypto winter).

A little background for the video you are about to watch. In 2013 in the country of Cyprus ( Where I am from ) The central bank and Laiki bank had freezed the citizen's bank accounts and couldn't do any actions for 2 weeks. The central bank and Laiki bank confiscated all the money you had but left you with 100.000 Euros. e.g. If you had 100.001, they took 1 euro. If You had 230.000, they confiscated 130.000 euros, If you had less than 99.999 they didn't take anything, and so on. Wikipedia says that if you had more than 100.000 they confiscated 47.5% of them but I am not quite sure and cannot find any reliable sources about this information, this all happened when I was 13 so I cannot remember much myself but I do remember the day and it was awful. The reason behind all this is that Cyprus financial management and investments were not the greatest and so we had a financial collapse. I could be mistaken somewhere, If I am correct me.

I put this video for you to watch for the fact that they talked about Bitcoin back then from such a small country and that it was an escape for even back then

Ive read all the basic normal stuff, but still dont really get how it works exactly:

&amp;#x200B;

1.Does the ledger hardware wallet or the live ledger app create the wallet address? It should be the hardware wallet right? Im assuming this is what the coin app on the wallet does, right? And then the hardware wallet shares the address with the live app, right?

2. The live app is not needed to keep installed on my phone correct? Im just holding and regardless if i uninstall the app or get a new phone and reinstall the app on that phone, or just use my computer in the future. The live app just syncs with the hardware wallet. And i dont need to keep anything from the app, correct?

3. If the live app isnt actually doing anything except acting as a interface into the hardware wallet. Is it getting the balance data (how much btc i have) just from the last sync with the hardware wallet? So if have my balance on my wallet that i used the phone app to transfer into it. Then connect the hardware wallet to my computer and transferred some btc away to a friend. The phone app would still display the old balance right? Or would it know, not because it had access to the btc. But because its keeping an eye on the address on the block chain?

4. If someone were to get my hardware wallet, all they need to do is crack my pin to access my funds right? Since the live ledger app doesnt actually have anything related to access my funds and doesnt do anything except serve as a interface. correct?

5. I seriously dont get the whole 24 pass phrase thing. How exactly does this phrase or the phrase for electrum, or what ever wallet. Actually connect to the blockchain and enable this location on the chain to be enabled. Like what is enabling or authorizing wallets like ledger or electrum to have access to the chain?

6. How is the ledger wallet able to use one 24 pass phrase for multiple block chains?

7. If i lose my ledger: This is a security risk if i dont generate a new 24 phrase correct? All someone needs to do is crack my pin. So do i essentially have to: recover the phrase on new ledger, send funds to my kraken account wallet, wipe the new ledger and generate NEW 24 phrase, send the funds from kraken to new ledger?",Need helping understanding some of this stuff,0

I no longer care about buying a house with a mortgage, now that I own bitcoin. I'm very lucky to have nice parents who let me live with them, so I have no real reason to move out.

My only plan is to wait on bitcoin to grow and in 5-10 years I can use some of the profits to buy a house outright, no mortgage required. I will buy some alt coins as well, but mostly bitcoin.

1) I understand that miners use hash functions to check if transactions but i don't really understand how that works and what they are actually looking for  


2) To get the odds of having the right hash and getting the 6.5 bitcoins can I just divide the hashrate of my device by the hashrate of all the miners ?

Growing up I never forgot how they gave us the Euro when I was a kid in the early 2000s. Initially for every 'deutsche mark' we got 0.5 Euros, but I was super confused when my parents told me that their salary got divided by 2 (x0.5), but consumer prices went back to the ""old"" deutsche mark prices within one year - meaning as an end result they didn't get divided, but salaries stagnated. I was ~8 years old at the time, didn't understand what was going on, but felt that something super strange happened. 

In 2008 the financial crisis/euro crisis hit, people where afraid, the media went crazy and when I was ~14 years old I needed to learn that I can't get interest at the bank when I want to save my money for hard times in the future.

I finished school, went to university, studied medicine, did my PhD and looked at the world: House prices doubled!
I realized that even as a physician in Germany I will not be able to buy a house in my home town without being indebted until the rest of my life, will not have the financial freedom to pursue projects which might take time.

I got depressed, I questioned everything, why do I even get up in the morning? My whole life I tried to do everything right, I saved for my future family, I studied, did research, but there was no chance of getting out of the debt-machinery.


Then I discovered Bitcoin. 

I learned about austrian economics, time preference and how fiat is affecting every single aspect of our lives, including morals, and the general perspective we look at our life's.

I pray to God that Bitcoin will continue to transform the life's of people on the globe, like it did mine.

I was lost, but now I'm found.

Thanks to everybody building and supporting the Bitcoin network.",Bitcoin is hope.,785

post,v2fujx,2s3qj,bitcoin,false,1654086476,https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/v2fujx/inflation_and_the_quantity_equation/,self.bitcoin,,"Hello, I have been anticipating a high inflation since early 2020 when the pandemic and the global lockdowns started due to the following equation I learned about in my macro-economy class in my university.

M¬†√ó¬†v¬†=¬†P¬†√ó¬†Y ¬†

M = money supply
v = velocity of money
P = price level
Y = real gross domestic product

The quantity equation can be used to derive how inflation arises.

It has to be said that, in my approach, the lockdowns are largely responsible for the change and decrease in the velocity of money circulation. This is an absolutely new phenomenon in human history, as there has never been a global pandemic or global lockdown like this one before. At the same time, the money supply and the new debt of the states increased globally to rescue and help companies financially. When the lockdowns were partially lifted, the speed/velocity of money circulation increased due to increased consumption with a large amount of money. The more we get closer to normal life again, the more can be consumed with an increased amount of money supply.  In the end, a lot of money and a high circulation speed ensure a rising price level or inflation. Because this was and is such a huge global phenomenon, inflation is as high as we are currently seeing. I'd love to have a discussion in the comments.",Inflation and the quantity equation,4
