# financial analysis for crypto currencies

Currency Market is corrolated to the google trends. When the coin has an increasing trend, market price is corrolated to the sentiment of the day. 

When it has a decreasing trend, the market price has a tendency to decrease.

This project still has time to finish, just wanted to show my preliminary study, you can read the First_Draft.pdf to read the results, the codes are not up to date they are just to give an idea.
